"""
ffmpeg-core: Core runtime for typed-ffmpeg.

This package contains the hand-written runtime code that is shared across
all FFmpeg version bindings. It includes:

- Compile layer: FFmpeg command generation
- IR layer: Intermediate representation for multi-backend support
- Common utilities: Serialization, schemas, etc.
- FFprobe: Media file probing

Note: DAG layer has been moved to version-specific packages to avoid
circular dependencies with generated code.
