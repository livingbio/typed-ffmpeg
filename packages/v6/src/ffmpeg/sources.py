Temporally interleave frames from several inputs.

interleave works with video inputs, ainterleave with audio.

These filters read frames from several inputs and send the oldest
queued frame to the output.

Input streams must have well defined, monotonically increasing frame
timestamp values.

In order to submit one frame to output, these filters need to enqueue
at least one frame for each input, so they cannot work in case one
input is not yet terminated and will not receive incoming frames.

For example consider the case when one input is a select filter
which always drops input frames. The interleave filter will keep
reading from that input, but it will never be able to send new frames
to output until the input sends an end-of-stream signal.

Also, depending on inputs synchronization, the filters will drop
frames in case one input receives more frames than the other ones, and
the queue is already filled.

Create a pattern generated by an elementary cellular automaton.

The initial state of the cellular automaton can be defined through the
filename and pattern options. If such options are
not specified an initial state is created randomly.

At each new frame a new row in the video is filled with the result of
the cellular automaton next generation. The behavior when the whole
frame is filled is defined by the scroll option.

This source accepts the following options:


Args:
    filename: Read the initial cellular automaton state, i.e. the starting row, from the specified file. In the file, each non-whitespace character is considered an alive cell, a newline will terminate the row, and further characters in the file will be ignored.
    pattern: Read the initial cellular automaton state, i.e. the starting row, from the specified string. Each non-whitespace character in the string is considered an alive cell, a newline will terminate the row, and further characters in the string will be ignored.
    rate: Set the video rate, that is the number of frames generated per second. Default is 25.
    size: Set the size of the output video. For the syntax of this option, check the "Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. If filename or pattern is specified, the size is set by default to the width of the specified initial state row, and the height is set to width * PHI. If size is set, it must contain the width of the specified pattern string, and the specified pattern will be centered in the larger row. If a filename or a pattern string is not specified, the size value defaults to "320x518" (used for a randomly generated initial state).
    rule: Set the cellular automaton rule, it is a number ranging from 0 to 255. Default value is 110.
    random_fill_ratio: Set the random fill ratio for the initial cellular automaton row. It is a floating point number value ranging from 0 to 1, defaults to 1/PHI. This option is ignored when a file or a pattern is specified.
    random_seed: Set the seed for filling randomly the initial row, must be an integer included between 0 and UINT32_MAX. If not specified, or if explicitly set to -1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best effort basis.
    scroll: If set to 1, scroll the output upward when all the rows in the output have been already filled. If set to 0, the new generated row will be written over the top row just after the bottom row is filled. Defaults to 1.
    start_full: If set to 1, completely fill the output with generated rows before outputting the first frame. This is the default behavior, for disabling set the value to 0.
    full: If set to 1, completely fill the output with generated rows before outputting the first frame. This is the default behavior, for disabling set the value to 0.

intended for testing purposes.

The testsrc2 source is similar to testsrc, but supports more
pixel formats instead of just rgb24. This allows using it as an
input for other tests without requiring a format conversion.

The yuvtestsrc source generates an YUV test pattern. You should
see a y, cb and cr stripe from top to bottom.

The sources accept the following parameters:


Args:
    size: Specify the size of the sourced video. For the syntax of this option, check the "Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. The default value is 320x240. This option is not available with the allrgb, allyuv, and haldclutsrc filters.
    rate: Specify the frame rate of the sourced video, as the number of frames generated per second. It has to be a string in the format frame_rate_num/frame_rate_den, an integer number, a floating point number or a valid video frame rate abbreviation. The default value is "25".
    duration: Set the duration of the sourced video. See the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual for the accepted syntax. If not specified, or the expressed duration is negative, the video is supposed to be generated forever. Since the frame rate is used as time base, all frames including the last one will have their full duration. If the specified duration is not a multiple of the frame duration, it will be rounded up.
    sar: Set the sample aspect ratio of the sourced video.
    type: Set the type of the color spectrum, only available in the colorspectrum source. Can be one of the following: @end table

    """

Field matching filter for inverse telecine. It is meant to reconstruct the
progressive frames from a telecined stream. The filter does not drop duplicated
frames, so to achieve a complete inverse telecine fieldmatch needs to be
followed by a decimation filter such as decimate in the filtergraph.

The separation of the field matching and the decimation is notably motivated by
the possibility of inserting a de-interlacing filter fallback between the two.
If the source has mixed telecined and real interlaced content,
fieldmatch will not be able to match fields for the interlaced parts.
But these remaining combed frames will be marked as interlaced, and thus can be
de-interlaced by a later filter such as yadif before decimation.

In addition to the various configuration options, fieldmatch can take an
optional second stream, activated through the ppsrc option. If
enabled, the frames reconstruction will be based on the fields and frames from
this second stream. This allows the first input to be pre-processed in order to
help the various algorithms of the filter, while keeping the output lossless
(assuming the fields are matched properly). Typically, a field-aware denoiser,
or brightness/contrast adjustments can help.

Note that this filter uses the same algorithms as TIVTC/TFM (AviSynth project)
and VIVTC/VFM (VapourSynth project). The later is a light clone of TFM from
which fieldmatch is based on. While the semantic and usage are very
close, some behaviour and options names can differ.

The decimate filter currently only works for constant frame rate input.
If your input has mixed telecined (30fps) and progressive content with a lower
framerate like 24fps use the following filterchain to produce the necessary cfr
stream: dejudder,fps=30000/1001,fieldmatch,decimate.

The filter accepts the following options:


Args:
    order: Specify the assumed field order of the input stream. Available values are: @end table Note that it is sometimes recommended not to trust the parity announced by the stream. Default value is auto.
    mode: Set the matching mode or strategy to use. pc mode is the safest in the sense that it won't risk creating jerkiness due to duplicate frames when possible, but if there are bad edits or blended fields it will end up outputting combed frames when a good match might actually exist. On the other hand, pcn_ub mode is the most risky in terms of creating jerkiness, but will almost always find a good frame if there is one. The other values are all somewhere in between pc and pcn_ub in terms of risking jerkiness and creating duplicate frames versus finding good matches in sections with bad edits, orphaned fields, blended fields, etc. More details about p/c/n/u/b are available in p/c/n/u/b meaning section. Available values are: @end table The parenthesis at the end indicate the matches that would be used for that mode assuming order=tff (and field on auto or top). In terms of speed pc mode is by far the fastest and pcn_ub is the slowest. Default value is pc_n.
    ppsrc: Mark the main input stream as a pre-processed input, and enable the secondary input stream as the clean source to pick the fields from. See the filter introduction for more details. It is similar to the clip2 feature from VFM/TFM. Default value is 0 (disabled).
    field: Set the field to match from. It is recommended to set this to the same value as order unless you experience matching failures with that setting. In certain circumstances changing the field that is used to match from can have a large impact on matching performance. Available values are: @end table Default value is auto.
    mchroma: Set whether or not chroma is included during the match comparisons. In most cases it is recommended to leave this enabled. You should set this to 0 only if your clip has bad chroma problems such as heavy rainbowing or other artifacts. Setting this to 0 could also be used to speed things up at the cost of some accuracy. Default value is 1.
    y0: define an exclusion band which excludes the lines between y0 and y1 from the field matching decision (from 0 to INT_MAX) (default 0)
    scthresh: Set the scene change detection threshold as a percentage of maximum change on the luma plane. Good values are in the [8.0, 14.0] range. Scene change detection is only relevant in case combmatch=sc. The range for scthresh is [0.0, 100.0]. Default value is 12.0.
    combmatch: When combatch is not none, fieldmatch will take into account the combed scores of matches when deciding what match to use as the final match. Available values are: @end table Default is sc.
    combdbg: Force fieldmatch to calculate the combed metrics for certain matches and print them. This setting is known as micout in TFM/VFM vocabulary. Available values are: @end table Default value is none.
    cthresh: This is the area combing threshold used for combed frame detection. This essentially controls how "strong" or "visible" combing must be to be detected. Larger values mean combing must be more visible and smaller values mean combing can be less visible or strong and still be detected. Valid settings are from -1 (every pixel will be detected as combed) to 255 (no pixel will be detected as combed). This is basically a pixel difference value. A good range is [8, 12]. Default value is 9.
    chroma: Sets whether or not chroma is considered in the combed frame decision. Only disable this if your source has chroma problems (rainbowing, etc.) that are causing problems for the combed frame detection with chroma enabled. Actually, using chroma=0 is usually more reliable, except for the case where there is chroma only combing in the source. Default value is 0.
    blockx: set the x-axis size of the window used during combed frame detection (from 4 to 512) (default 16)
    blocky: Respectively set the x-axis and y-axis size of the window used during combed frame detection. This has to do with the size of the area in which combpel pixels are required to be detected as combed for a frame to be declared combed. See the combpel parameter description for more info. Possible values are any number that is a power of 2 starting at 4 and going up to 512. Default value is 16.
    combpel: The number of combed pixels inside any of the blocky by blockx size blocks on the frame for the frame to be detected as combed. While cthresh controls how "visible" the combing must be, this setting controls "how much" combing there must be in any localized area (a window defined by the blockx and blocky settings) on the frame. Minimum value is 0 and maximum is blocky x blockx (at which point no frames will ever be detected as combed). This setting is known as MI in TFM/VFM vocabulary. Default value is 80.

Temporally interleave frames from several inputs.

interleave works with video inputs, ainterleave with audio.

These filters read frames from several inputs and send the oldest
queued frame to the output.

Input streams must have well defined, monotonically increasing frame
timestamp values.

In order to submit one frame to output, these filters need to enqueue
at least one frame for each input, so they cannot work in case one
input is not yet terminated and will not receive incoming frames.

For example consider the case when one input is a select filter
which always drops input frames. The interleave filter will keep
reading from that input, but it will never be able to send new frames
to output until the input sends an end-of-stream signal.

Also, depending on inputs synchronization, the filters will drop
frames in case one input receives more frames than the other ones, and
the queue is already filled.

Generate a life pattern.

This source is based on a generalization of John Conway's life game.

The sourced input represents a life grid, each pixel represents a cell
which can be in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell
interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

At each interaction the grid evolves according to the adopted rule,
which specifies the number of neighbor alive cells which will make a
cell stay alive or born. The rule option allows one to specify
the rule to adopt.

This source accepts the following options:


Args:
    filename: Set the file from which to read the initial grid state. In the file, each non-whitespace character is considered an alive cell, and newline is used to delimit the end of each row. If this option is not specified, the initial grid is generated randomly.
    size: Set the size of the output video. For the syntax of this option, check the "Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. If filename is specified, the size is set by default to the same size of the input file. If size is set, it must contain the size specified in the input file, and the initial grid defined in that file is centered in the larger resulting area. If a filename is not specified, the size value defaults to "320x240" (used for a randomly generated initial grid).
    rate: Set the video rate, that is the number of frames generated per second. Default is 25.
    rule: Set the life rule. A rule can be specified with a code of the kind "SNS/BNB", where NS and NB are sequences of numbers in the range 0-8, NS specifies the number of alive neighbor cells which make a live cell stay alive, and NB the number of alive neighbor cells which make a dead cell to become alive (i.e. to "born"). "s" and "b" can be used in place of "S" and "B", respectively. Alternatively a rule can be specified by an 18-bits integer. The 9 high order bits are used to encode the next cell state if it is alive for each number of neighbor alive cells, the low order bits specify the rule for "borning" new cells. Higher order bits encode for an higher number of neighbor cells. For example the number 6153 = (12<<9)+9 specifies a stay alive rule of 12 and a born rule of 9, which corresponds to "S23/B03". Default value is "S23/B3", which is the original Conway's game of life rule, and will keep a cell alive if it has 2 or 3 neighbor alive cells, and will born a new cell if there are three alive cells around a dead cell.
    random_fill_ratio: Set the random fill ratio for the initial random grid. It is a floating point number value ranging from 0 to 1, defaults to 1/PHI. It is ignored when a file is specified.
    random_seed: Set the seed for filling the initial random grid, must be an integer included between 0 and UINT32_MAX. If not specified, or if explicitly set to -1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best effort basis.
    stitch: If set to 1, stitch the left and right grid edges together, and the top and bottom edges also. Defaults to 1.
    mold: Set cell mold speed. If set, a dead cell will go from death_color to mold_color with a step of mold. mold can have a value from 0 to 255.
    life_color: Set the color of living (or new born) cells.
    death_color: Set the color of dead cells. If mold is set, this is the first color used to represent a dead cell.
    mold_color: Set mold color, for definitely dead and moldy cells. For the syntax of these 3 color options, check the "Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual.

It accepts the following parameters:


Args:
    filename: The name of the resource to read (not necessarily a file; it can also be a device or a stream accessed through some protocol).
    format_name: Specifies the format assumed for the movie to read, and can be either the name of a container or an input device. If not specified, the format is guessed from movie_name or by probing.
    stream_index: Specifies the index of the video stream to read. If the value is -1, the most suitable video stream will be automatically selected. The default value is "-1". Deprecated. If the filter is called "amovie", it will select audio instead of video.
    seek_point: Specifies the seek point in seconds. The frames will be output starting from this seek point. The parameter is evaluated with av_strtod, so the numerical value may be suffixed by an IS postfix. The default value is "0".
    streams: Specifies the streams to read. Several streams can be specified, separated by "+". The source will then have as many outputs, in the same order. The syntax is explained in the "Stream specifiers" section in the ffmpeg manual. Two special names, "dv" and "da" specify respectively the default (best suited) video and audio stream. Default is "dv", or "da" if the filter is called as "amovie".
    loop: Specifies how many times to read the stream in sequence. If the value is 0, the stream will be looped infinitely. Default value is "1". Note that when the movie is looped the source timestamps are not changed, so it will generate non monotonically increasing timestamps.
    discontinuity: Specifies the time difference between frames above which the point is considered a timestamp discontinuity which is removed by adjusting the later timestamps.
    dec_threads: Specifies the number of threads for decoding
    format_opts: Specify format options for the opened file. Format options can be specified as a list of key=value pairs separated by ':'. The following example shows how to add protocol_whitelist and protocol_blacklist options: @example ffplay -f lavfi "movie=filename='1.sdp':format_opts='protocol_whitelist=file,rtp,udp\:protocol_blacklist=http'" @end example

Calculates the MPEG-7 Video Signature. The filter can handle more than one
input. In this case the matching between the inputs can be calculated additionally.
The filter always passes through the first input. The signature of each stream can
be written into a file.

It accepts the following options:


Args:
    detectmode: Enable or disable the matching process. Available values are: @end table
    nb_inputs: Set the number of inputs. The option value must be a non negative integer. Default value is 1.
    filename: Set the path to which the output is written. If there is more than one input, the path must be a prototype, i.e. must contain %d or %0nd (where n is a positive integer), that will be replaced with the input number. If no filename is specified, no output will be written. This is the default.
    format: Choose the output format. Available values are: @end table
    th_d: Set threshold to detect one word as similar. The option value must be an integer greater than zero. The default value is 9000.
    th_dc: Set threshold to detect all words as similar. The option value must be an integer greater than zero. The default value is 60000.
    th_xh: Set threshold to detect frames as similar. The option value must be an integer greater than zero. The default value is 116.
    th_di: Set the minimum length of a sequence in frames to recognize it as matching sequence. The option value must be a non negative integer value. The default value is 0.
    th_it: Set the minimum relation, that matching frames to all frames must have. The option value must be a double value between 0 and 1. The default value is 0.5.

Stack video inputs into custom layout.

All streams must be of same pixel format.

The filter accepts the following options:


Args:
    inputs: Set number of input streams. Default is 2.
    layout: Specify layout of inputs. This option requires the desired layout configuration to be explicitly set by the user. This sets position of each video input in output. Each input is separated by '|'. The first number represents the column, and the second number represents the row. Numbers start at 0 and are separated by '_'. Optionally one can use wX and hX, where X is video input from which to take width or height. Multiple values can be used when separated by '+'. In such case values are summed together. Note that if inputs are of different sizes gaps may appear, as not all of the output video frame will be filled. Similarly, videos can overlap each other if their position doesn't leave enough space for the full frame of adjoining videos. For 2 inputs, a default layout of 0_0|w0_0 (equivalent to grid=2x1) is set. In all other cases, a layout or a grid must be set by the user. Either grid or layout can be specified at a time. Specifying both will result in an error.
    grid: Specify a fixed size grid of inputs. This option is used to create a fixed size grid of the input streams. Set the grid size in the form COLUMNSxROWS. There must be ROWS * COLUMNS input streams and they will be arranged as a grid with ROWS rows and COLUMNS columns. When using this option, each input stream within a row must have the same height and all the rows must have the same width. If grid is set, then inputs option is ignored and is implicitly set to ROWS * COLUMNS. For 2 inputs, a default grid of 2x1 (equivalent to layout=0_0|w0_0) is set. In all other cases, a layout or a grid must be set by the user. Either grid or layout can be specified at a time. Specifying both will result in an error.
    shortest: If set to 1, force the output to terminate when the shortest input terminates. Default value is 0.
    fill: If set to valid color, all unused pixels will be filled with that color. By default fill is set to none, so it is disabled.

The allrgb source returns frames of size 4096x4096 of all rgb colors.

The allyuv source returns frames of size 4096x4096 of all yuv colors.

The color source provides an uniformly colored input.

The colorchart source provides a colors checker chart.

The colorspectrum source provides a color spectrum input.

The haldclutsrc source provides an identity Hald CLUT. See also
haldclut filter.

The nullsrc source returns unprocessed video frames. It is
mainly useful to be employed in analysis / debugging tools, or as the
source for filters which ignore the input data.

The pal75bars source generates a color bars pattern, based on
EBU PAL recommendations with 75% color levels.

The pal100bars source generates a color bars pattern, based on
EBU PAL recommendations with 100% color levels.

The rgbtestsrc source generates an RGB test pattern useful for
detecting RGB vs BGR issues. You should see a red, green and blue
stripe from top to bottom.

The smptebars source generates a color bars pattern, based on
the SMPTE Engineering Guideline EG 1-1990.

The smptehdbars source generates a color bars pattern, based on
the SMPTE RP 219-2002.

The testsrc source generates a test video pattern, showing a
color pattern, a scrolling gradient and a timestamp. This is mainly
intended for testing purposes.

The testsrc2 source is similar to testsrc, but supports more
pixel formats instead of just rgb24. This allows using it as an
input for other tests without requiring a format conversion.

The yuvtestsrc source generates an YUV test pattern. You should
see a y, cb and cr stripe from top to bottom.

The sources accept the following parameters:


Args:
    size: Specify the size of the sourced video. For the syntax of this option, check the "Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. The default value is 320x240. This option is not available with the allrgb, allyuv, and haldclutsrc filters.
    rate: Specify the frame rate of the sourced video, as the number of frames generated per second. It has to be a string in the format frame_rate_num/frame_rate_den, an integer number, a floating point number or a valid video frame rate abbreviation. The default value is "25".
    duration: Set the duration of the sourced video. See the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual for the accepted syntax. If not specified, or the expressed duration is negative, the video is supposed to be generated forever. Since the frame rate is used as time base, all frames including the last one will have their full duration. If the specified duration is not a multiple of the frame duration, it will be rounded up.
    sar: Set the sample aspect ratio of the sourced video.

Returns:
    default: the video stream
