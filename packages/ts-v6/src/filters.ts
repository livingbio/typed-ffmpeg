/**
 * Temporally interleave frames from several inputs. interleave works with video inputs, ainterleave with audio. These filters read frames from several inputs and send the oldest queued frame to the output. Input streams must have well defined, monotonically increasing frame timestamp values. In order to submit one frame to output, these filters need to enqueue at least one frame for each input, so they cannot work in case one input is not yet terminated and will not receive incoming frames. For example consider the case when one input is a select filter which always drops input frames. The interleave filter will keep reading from that input, but it will never be able to send new frames to output until the input sends an end-of-stream signal. Also, depending on inputs synchronization, the filters will drop frames in case one input receives more frames than the other ones, and the queue is already filled. These filters accept the following options:

 *
 * @param options.nb_inputs - Set the number of different inputs, it is 2 by default.
 * @param options.duration - How to determine the end-of-stream. @end table

/**
 * Field matching filter for inverse telecine. It is meant to reconstruct the progressive frames from a telecined stream. The filter does not drop duplicated frames, so to achieve a complete inverse telecine fieldmatch needs to be followed by a decimation filter such as decimate in the filtergraph. The separation of the field matching and the decimation is notably motivated by the possibility of inserting a de-interlacing filter fallback between the two. If the source has mixed telecined and real interlaced content, fieldmatch will not be able to match fields for the interlaced parts. But these remaining combed frames will be marked as interlaced, and thus can be de-interlaced by a later filter such as yadif before decimation. In addition to the various configuration options, fieldmatch can take an optional second stream, activated through the ppsrc option. If enabled, the frames reconstruction will be based on the fields and frames from this second stream. This allows the first input to be pre-processed in order to help the various algorithms of the filter, while keeping the output lossless (assuming the fields are matched properly). Typically, a field-aware denoiser, or brightness/contrast adjustments can help. Note that this filter uses the same algorithms as TIVTC/TFM (AviSynth project) and VIVTC/VFM (VapourSynth project). The later is a light clone of TFM from which fieldmatch is based on. While the semantic and usage are very close, some behaviour and options names can differ. The decimate filter currently only works for constant frame rate input. If your input has mixed telecined (30fps) and progressive content with a lower framerate like 24fps use the following filterchain to produce the necessary cfr stream: dejudder,fps=30000/1001,fieldmatch,decimate. The filter accepts the following options:

 *
 * @param options.order - Specify the assumed field order of the input stream. Available values are: @end table Note that it is sometimes recommended not to trust the parity announced by the stream. Default value is auto.
 * @param options.mode - Set the matching mode or strategy to use. pc mode is the safest in the sense that it won't risk creating jerkiness due to duplicate frames when possible, but if there are bad edits or blended fields it will end up outputting combed frames when a good match might actually exist. On the other hand, pcn_ub mode is the most risky in terms of creating jerkiness, but will almost always find a good frame if there is one. The other values are all somewhere in between pc and pcn_ub in terms of risking jerkiness and creating duplicate frames versus finding good matches in sections with bad edits, orphaned fields, blended fields, etc. More details about p/c/n/u/b are available in p/c/n/u/b meaning section. Available values are: @end table The parenthesis at the end indicate the matches that would be used for that mode assuming order=tff (and field on auto or top). In terms of speed pc mode is by far the fastest and pcn_ub is the slowest. Default value is pc_n.
 * @param options.ppsrc - Mark the main input stream as a pre-processed input, and enable the secondary input stream as the clean source to pick the fields from. See the filter introduction for more details. It is similar to the clip2 feature from VFM/TFM. Default value is 0 (disabled).
 * @param options.field - Set the field to match from. It is recommended to set this to the same value as order unless you experience matching failures with that setting. In certain circumstances changing the field that is used to match from can have a large impact on matching performance. Available values are: @end table Default value is auto.
 * @param options.mchroma - Set whether or not chroma is included during the match comparisons. In most cases it is recommended to leave this enabled. You should set this to 0 only if your clip has bad chroma problems such as heavy rainbowing or other artifacts. Setting this to 0 could also be used to speed things up at the cost of some accuracy. Default value is 1.
 * @param options.y0 - define an exclusion band which excludes the lines between y0 and y1 from the field matching decision (from 0 to INT_MAX) (default 0)
 * @param options.scthresh - Set the scene change detection threshold as a percentage of maximum change on the luma plane. Good values are in the [8.0, 14.0] range. Scene change detection is only relevant in case combmatch=sc. The range for scthresh is [0.0, 100.0]. Default value is 12.0.
 * @param options.combmatch - When combatch is not none, fieldmatch will take into account the combed scores of matches when deciding what match to use as the final match. Available values are: @end table Default is sc.
 * @param options.combdbg - Force fieldmatch to calculate the combed metrics for certain matches and print them. This setting is known as micout in TFM/VFM vocabulary. Available values are: @end table Default value is none.
 * @param options.cthresh - This is the area combing threshold used for combed frame detection. This essentially controls how "strong" or "visible" combing must be to be detected. Larger values mean combing must be more visible and smaller values mean combing can be less visible or strong and still be detected. Valid settings are from -1 (every pixel will be detected as combed) to 255 (no pixel will be detected as combed). This is basically a pixel difference value. A good range is [8, 12]. Default value is 9.
 * @param options.chroma - Sets whether or not chroma is considered in the combed frame decision. Only disable this if your source has chroma problems (rainbowing, etc.) that are causing problems for the combed frame detection with chroma enabled. Actually, using chroma=0 is usually more reliable, except for the case where there is chroma only combing in the source. Default value is 0.
 * @param options.blockx - set the x-axis size of the window used during combed frame detection (from 4 to 512) (default 16)
 * @param options.blocky - Respectively set the x-axis and y-axis size of the window used during combed frame detection. This has to do with the size of the area in which combpel pixels are required to be detected as combed for a frame to be declared combed. See the combpel parameter description for more info. Possible values are any number that is a power of 2 starting at 4 and going up to 512. Default value is 16.
 * @param options.combpel - The number of combed pixels inside any of the blocky by blockx size blocks on the frame for the frame to be detected as combed. While cthresh controls how "visible" the combing must be, this setting controls "how much" combing there must be in any localized area (a window defined by the blockx and blocky settings) on the frame. Minimum value is 0 and maximum is blocky x blockx (at which point no frames will ever be detected as combed). This setting is known as MI in TFM/VFM vocabulary. Default value is 80.

This filter takes in input two input videos, the first input is considered the "main" source and is passed unchanged to the output. The second input is used as a "reference" video for computing the PSNR. Both video inputs must have the same resolution and pixel format for this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one. The obtained average PSNR is printed through the logging system. The filter stores the accumulated MSE (mean squared error) of each frame, and at the end of the processing it is averaged across all frames equally, and the following formula is applied to obtain the PSNR: @example PSNR = 10*log10(MAX^2/MSE) @end example Where MAX is the average of the maximum values of each component of the image.

/**
 * This filter acts like normal compressor but has the ability to compress detected signal using second input signal. It needs two input streams and returns one output stream. First input stream will be processed depending on second stream signal. The filtered signal then can be filtered with other filters in later stages of processing. See pan and amerge filter. The filter accepts the following options:

 *
 * @param options.level_in - Set input gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625 and 64.
 * @param options.mode - Set mode of compressor operation. Can be upward or downward. Default is downward.
 * @param options.threshold - If a signal of second stream raises above this level it will affect the gain reduction of first stream. By default is 0.125. Range is between 0.00097563 and 1.
 * @param options.ratio - Set a ratio about which the signal is reduced. 1:2 means that if the level raised 4dB above the threshold, it will be only 2dB above after the reduction. Default is 2. Range is between 1 and 20.
 * @param options.attack - Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain reduction starts. Default is 20. Range is between 0.01 and 2000.
 * @param options.release - Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before reduction is decreased again. Default is 250. Range is between 0.01 and 9000.
 * @param options.makeup - Set the amount by how much signal will be amplified after processing. Default is 1. Range is from 1 to 64.
 * @param options.knee - Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly. Default is 2.82843. Range is between 1 and 8.
 * @param options.link - Choose if the average level between all channels of side-chain stream or the louder(maximum) channel of side-chain stream affects the reduction. Default is average.
 * @param options.detection - Should the exact signal be taken in case of peak or an RMS one in case of rms. Default is rms which is mainly smoother.
 * @param options.level_sc - Set sidechain gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625 and 64.
 * @param options.mix - How much to use compressed signal in output. Default is 1. Range is between 0 and 1.

/**
 * A sidechain gate acts like a normal (wideband) gate but has the ability to filter the detected signal before sending it to the gain reduction stage. Normally a gate uses the full range signal to detect a level above the threshold. For example: If you cut all lower frequencies from your sidechain signal the gate will decrease the volume of your track only if not enough highs appear. With this technique you are able to reduce the resonation of a natural drum or remove "rumbling" of muted strokes from a heavily distorted guitar. It needs two input streams and returns one output stream. First input stream will be processed depending on second stream signal. The filter accepts the following options:

 *
 * @param options.level_in - Set input level before filtering. Default is 1. Allowed range is from 0.015625 to 64.
 * @param options.mode - Set the mode of operation. Can be upward or downward. Default is downward. If set to upward mode, higher parts of signal will be amplified, expanding dynamic range in upward direction. Otherwise, in case of downward lower parts of signal will be reduced.
 * @param options.range - Set the level of gain reduction when the signal is below the threshold. Default is 0.06125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1. Setting this to 0 disables reduction and then filter behaves like expander.
 * @param options.threshold - If a signal rises above this level the gain reduction is released. Default is 0.125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.
 * @param options.ratio - Set a ratio about which the signal is reduced. Default is 2. Allowed range is from 1 to 9000.
 * @param options.attack - Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain reduction stops. Default is 20 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.
 * @param options.release - Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before the reduction is increased again. Default is 250 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.
 * @param options.makeup - Set amount of amplification of signal after processing. Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 64.
 * @param options.knee - Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly. Default is 2.828427125. Allowed range is from 1 to 8.
 * @param options.detection - Choose if exact signal should be taken for detection or an RMS like one. Default is rms. Can be peak or rms.
 * @param options.link - Choose if the average level between all channels or the louder channel affects the reduction. Default is average. Can be average or maximum.
 * @param options.level_sc - Set sidechain gain. Default is 1. Range is from 0.015625 to 64.

 * Synthesize audio from 2 input video spectrums, first input stream represents magnitude across time and second represents phase across time. The filter will transform from frequency domain as displayed in videos back to time domain as presented in audio output. This filter is primarily created for reversing processed showspectrum filter outputs, but can synthesize sound from other spectrograms too. But in such case results are going to be poor if the phase data is not available, because in such cases phase data need to be recreated, usually it's just recreated from random noise. For best results use gray only output (channel color mode in showspectrum filter) and log scale for magnitude video and lin scale for phase video. To produce phase, for 2nd video, use data option. Inputs videos should generally use fullframe slide mode as that saves resources needed for decoding video. The filter accepts the following options:

 *
 * @param options.sample_rate - Specify sample rate of output audio, the sample rate of audio from which spectrum was generated may differ.
 * @param options.channels - Set number of channels represented in input video spectrums.
 * @param options.scale - Set scale which was used when generating magnitude input spectrum. Can be lin or log. Default is log.
 * @param options.slide - Set slide which was used when generating inputs spectrums. Can be replace, scroll, fullframe or rscroll. Default is fullframe.
 * @param options.win_func - Set window function used for resynthesis.
 * @param options.overlap - Set window overlap. In range [0, 1]. Default is 1, which means optimal overlap for selected window function will be picked.
 * @param options.orientation - Set orientation of input videos. Can be vertical or horizontal. Default is vertical.

Similarly, videos can overlap each other if their position doesn't leave enough space for the full frame of adjoining videos. For 2 inputs, a default layout of 0_0|w0_0 (equivalent to grid=2x1) is set. In all other cases, a layout or a grid must be set by the user. Either grid or layout can be specified at a time. Specifying both will result in an error.

There must be ROWS * COLUMNS input streams and they will be arranged as a grid with ROWS rows and COLUMNS columns.

 * @param options.shortest - See xstack.
 * @param options.layout - See xstack. Moreover, this permits the user to supply output size for each input stream. @example xstack_vaapi=inputs=4:layout=0_0_1920x1080|0_h0_1920x1080|w0_0_1920x1080|w0_h0_1920x1080 @end example
 * @param options.grid - See xstack.
 * @param options.grid_tile_size - Set output size for each input stream when grid is set. If this option is not set, this filter will set output size by default to the size of the first input stream. For the syntax of this option, check the "Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual.
 * @param options.fill - See xstack.
