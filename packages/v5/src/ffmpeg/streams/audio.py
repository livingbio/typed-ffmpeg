A compressor is mainly used to reduce the dynamic range of a signal.
Especially modern music is mostly compressed at a high ratio to
improve the overall loudness. It's done to get the highest attention
of a listener, "fatten" the sound and bring more "power" to the track.
If a signal is compressed too much it may sound dull or "dead"
afterwards or it may start to "pump" (which could be a powerful effect
but can also destroy a track completely).
The right compression is the key to reach a professional sound and is
the high art of mixing and mastering. Because of its complex settings
it may take a long time to get the right feeling for this kind of effect.

Compression is done by detecting the volume above a chosen level
threshold and dividing it by the factor set with ratio.
So if you set the threshold to -12dB and your signal reaches -6dB a ratio
of 2:1 will result in a signal at -9dB. Because an exact manipulation of
the signal would cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be
levelled over the time. This is done by setting "Attack" and "Release".
attack determines how long the signal has to rise above the threshold
before any reduction will occur and release sets the time the signal
has to fall below the threshold to reduce the reduction again. Shorter signals
than the chosen attack time will be left untouched.
The overall reduction of the signal can be made up afterwards with the
makeup setting. So compressing the peaks of a signal about 6dB and
raising the makeup to this level results in a signal twice as loud than the
source. To gain a softer entry in the compression the knee flattens the
hard edge at the threshold in the range of the chosen decibels.

The filter accepts the following options:


Args:
    level_in: Set input gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625 and 64.
    mode: Set mode of compressor operation. Can be upward or downward. Default is downward.
    threshold: If a signal of stream rises above this level it will affect the gain reduction. By default it is 0.125. Range is between 0.00097563 and 1.
    ratio: Set a ratio by which the signal is reduced. 1:2 means that if the level rose 4dB above the threshold, it will be only 2dB above after the reduction. Default is 2. Range is between 1 and 20.
    attack: Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain reduction starts. Default is 20. Range is between 0.01 and 2000.
    release: Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before reduction is decreased again. Default is 250. Range is between 0.01 and 9000.
    makeup: Set the amount by how much signal will be amplified after processing. Default is 1. Range is from 1 to 64.
    knee: Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly. Default is 2.82843. Range is between 1 and 8.
    link: Choose if the average level between all channels of input stream or the louder(maximum) channel of input stream affects the reduction. Default is average.
    detection: Should the exact signal be taken in case of peak or an RMS one in case of rms. Default is rms which is mostly smoother.
    level_sc: set sidechain gain (from 0.015625 to 64) (default 1)
    mix: How much to use compressed signal in output. Default is 1. Range is between 0 and 1.

Reduce audio bit resolution.

This filter is bit crusher with enhanced functionality. A bit crusher
is used to audibly reduce number of bits an audio signal is sampled
with. This doesn't change the bit depth at all, it just produces the
effect. Material reduced in bit depth sounds more harsh and "digital".
This filter is able to even round to continuous values instead of discrete
bit depths.
Additionally it has a D/C offset which results in different crushing of
the lower and the upper half of the signal.
An Anti-Aliasing setting is able to produce "softer" crushing sounds.

Another feature of this filter is the logarithmic mode.
This setting switches from linear distances between bits to logarithmic ones.
The result is a much more "natural" sounding crusher which doesn't gate low
signals for example. The human ear has a logarithmic perception,
so this kind of crushing is much more pleasant.
Logarithmic crushing is also able to get anti-aliased.

A gate is mainly used to reduce lower parts of a signal. This kind of signal
processing reduces disturbing noise between useful signals.

Gating is done by detecting the volume below a chosen level threshold
and dividing it by the factor set with ratio. The bottom of the noise
floor is set via range. Because an exact manipulation of the signal
would cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be levelled over
time. This is done by setting attack and release.

attack determines how long the signal has to fall below the threshold
before any reduction will occur and release sets the time the signal
has to rise above the threshold to reduce the reduction again.
Shorter signals than the chosen attack time will be left untouched.


Args:
    level_in: Set input level before filtering. Default is 1. Allowed range is from 0.015625 to 64.
    mode: Set the mode of operation. Can be upward or downward. Default is downward. If set to upward mode, higher parts of signal will be amplified, expanding dynamic range in upward direction. Otherwise, in case of downward lower parts of signal will be reduced.
    range: Set the level of gain reduction when the signal is below the threshold. Default is 0.06125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1. Setting this to 0 disables reduction and then filter behaves like expander.
    threshold: If a signal rises above this level the gain reduction is released. Default is 0.125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.
    ratio: Set a ratio by which the signal is reduced. Default is 2. Allowed range is from 1 to 9000.
    attack: Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain reduction stops. Default is 20 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.
    release: Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before the reduction is increased again. Default is 250 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.
    makeup: Set amount of amplification of signal after processing. Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 64.
    knee: Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly. Default is 2.828427125. Allowed range is from 1 to 8.
    detection: Choose if exact signal should be taken for detection or an RMS like one. Default is rms. Can be peak or rms.
    link: Choose if the average level between all channels or the louder channel affects the reduction. Default is average. Can be average or maximum.
    level_sc: set sidechain gain (from 0.015625 to 64) (default 1)

    attack: The limiter will reach its attenuation level in this amount of time in milliseconds. Default is 5 milliseconds.
    release: Come back from limiting to attenuation 1.0 in this amount of milliseconds. Default is 50 milliseconds.
    asc: When gain reduction is always needed ASC takes care of releasing to an average reduction level rather than reaching a reduction of 0 in the release time.
    asc_level: Select how much the release time is affected by ASC, 0 means nearly no changes in release time while 1 produces higher release times.
    level: Auto level output signal. Default is enabled. This normalizes audio back to 0dB if enabled.

representing mean phase of current audio frame. A video output can also be produced and is
enabled by default. The audio is passed through as first output.

Audio will be rematrixed to stereo if it has a different channel layout. Phase value is in
range [-1, 1] where -1 means left and right channels are completely out of phase
and 1 means channels are in phase.

The filter accepts the following options, all related to its video output:


Args:
    rate: Set the output frame rate. Default value is 25.
    size: Set the video size for the output. For the syntax of this option, check the "Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. Default value is 800x400.
    rc: set red contrast (from 0 to 255) (default 2)
    gc: set green contrast (from 0 to 255) (default 7)
    bc: Specify the red, green, blue contrast. Default values are 2, 7 and 1. Allowed range is [0, 255].
    mpc: Set color which will be used for drawing median phase. If color is none which is default, no median phase value will be drawn.
    video: Enable video output. Default is enabled.
    phasing: Enable mono and out of phase detection. Default is disabled.
    tolerance: Set phase tolerance for mono detection, in amplitude ratio. Default is 0. Allowed range is [0, 1].
    angle: Set angle threshold for out of phase detection, in degree. Default is 170. Allowed range is [90, 180].
    duration: Set mono or out of phase duration until notification, expressed in seconds. Default is 2.

Audio pulsator is something between an autopanner and a tremolo.
But it can produce funny stereo effects as well. Pulsator changes the volume
of the left and right channel based on a LFO (low frequency oscillator) with
different waveforms and shifted phases.
This filter have the ability to define an offset between left and right
channel. An offset of 0 means that both LFO shapes match each other.
The left and right channel are altered equally - a conventional tremolo.
An offset of 50% means that the shape of the right channel is exactly shifted
in phase (or moved backwards about half of the frequency) - pulsator acts as
an autopanner. At 1 both curves match again. Every setting in between moves the
phase shift gapless between all stages and produces some "bypassing" sounds with
sine and triangle waveforms. The more you set the offset near 1 (starting from
the 0.5) the faster the signal passes from the left to the right speaker.

    level_in: Set input gain. By default it is 1. Range is [0.015625 - 64].

Convert input audio to a video output, representing the audio vector
scope.

The filter is used to measure the difference between channels of stereo
audio stream. A monaural signal, consisting of identical left and right
signal, results in straight vertical line. Any stereo separation is visible
as a deviation from this line, creating a Lissajous figure.
If the straight (or deviation from it) but horizontal line appears this
indicates that the left and right channels are out of phase.

The filter accepts the following options:


Args:
    mode: Set the vectorscope mode. Available values are: @end table Default value is lissajous.
    rate: Set the output frame rate. Default value is 25.
    size: Set the video size for the output. For the syntax of this option, check the "Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. Default value is 400x400.

Receive commands sent through a libzmq client, and forward them to
filters in the filtergraph.

zmq and azmq work as a pass-through filters. zmq
must be inserted between two video filters, azmq between two
audio filters. Both are capable to send messages to any filter type.

To enable these filters you need to install the libzmq library and
headers and configure FFmpeg with --enable-libzmq.

For more information about libzmq see:
http://www.zeromq.org/

The zmq and azmq filters work as a libzmq server, which
receives messages sent through a network interface defined by the
bind_address (or the abbreviation "b") option.
Default value of this option is tcp://localhost:5555. You may
want to alter this value to your needs, but do not forget to escape any
':' signs (see filtergraph escaping).

The received message must be in the form:
@example
TARGET COMMAND [ARG]
@end example

TARGET specifies the target of the command, usually the name of
the filter class or a specific filter instance name. The default
filter instance name uses the pattern Parsed_<filter_name>_<index>,
but you can override this by using the filter_name@id syntax
(see Filtergraph syntax).

COMMAND specifies the name of the command for the target filter.

ARG is optional and specifies the optional argument list for the
given COMMAND.

Upon reception, the message is processed and the corresponding command
is injected into the filtergraph. Depending on the result, the filter
will send a reply to the client, adopting the format:
@example
ERROR_CODE ERROR_REASON
MESSAGE
@end example

MESSAGE is optional.

Chorus resembles an echo effect with a short delay, but whereas with echo the delay is

The modulation depth defines the range the modulated delay is played before or after
the delay. Hence the delayed sound will sound slower or faster, that is the delayed

It accepts the following parameters:


Args:
    attacks: set time over which increase of volume is determined (default "0")
    decays: A list of times in seconds for each channel over which the instantaneous level of the input signal is averaged to determine its volume. attacks refers to increase of volume and decays refers to decrease of volume. For most situations, the attack time (response to the audio getting louder) should be shorter than the decay time, because the human ear is more sensitive to sudden loud audio than sudden soft audio. A typical value for attack is 0.3 seconds and a typical value for decay is 0.8 seconds. If specified number of attacks & decays is lower than number of channels, the last set attack/decay will be used for all remaining channels.
    points: A list of points for the transfer function, specified in dB relative to the maximum possible signal amplitude. Each key points list must be defined using the following syntax: x0/y0|x1/y1|x2/y2|.... or x0/y0 x1/y1 x2/y2 .... The input values must be in strictly increasing order but the transfer function does not have to be monotonically rising. The point 0/0 is assumed but may be overridden (by 0/out-dBn). Typical values for the transfer function are -70/-70|-60/-20|1/0.
    soft_knee: Set the curve radius in dB for all joints. It defaults to 0.01.
    gain: Set the additional gain in dB to be applied at all points on the transfer function. This allows for easy adjustment of the overall gain. It defaults to 0.
    volume: Set an initial volume, in dB, to be assumed for each channel when filtering starts. This permits the user to supply a nominal level initially, so that, for example, a very large gain is not applied to initial signal levels before the companding has begun to operate. A typical value for audio which is initially quiet is -90 dB. It defaults to 0.
    delay: Set a delay, in seconds. The input audio is analyzed immediately, but audio is delayed before being fed to the volume adjuster. Specifying a delay approximately equal to the attack/decay times allows the filter to effectively operate in predictive rather than reactive mode. It defaults to 0.

Compensation Delay Line is a metric based delay to compensate differing
positions of microphones or speakers.

For example, you have recorded guitar with two microphones placed in
different locations. Because the front of sound wave has fixed speed in
normal conditions, the phasing of microphones can vary and depends on
their location and interposition. The best sound mix can be achieved when
these microphones are in phase (synchronized). Note that a distance of
~30 cm between microphones makes one microphone capture the signal in
antiphase to the other microphone. That makes the final mix sound moody.
This filter helps to solve phasing problems by adding different delays
to each microphone track and make them synchronized.

The best result can be reached when you take one track as base and
synchronize other tracks one by one with it.
Remember that synchronization/delay tolerance depends on sample rate, too.
Higher sample rates will give more tolerance.

The filter accepts the following parameters:


Args:
    mm: Set millimeters distance. This is compensation distance for fine tuning. Default is 0.
    cm: Set cm distance. This is compensation distance for tightening distance setup. Default is 0.

    strength: Set strength of crossfeed. Default is 0.2. Allowed range is from 0 to 1. This sets gain of low shelf filter for side part of stereo image. Default is -6dB. Max allowed is -30db when strength is set to 1.
    range: Set soundstage wideness. Default is 0.5. Allowed range is from 0 to 1. This sets cut off frequency of low shelf filter. Default is cut off near 1550 Hz. With range set to 1 cut off frequency is set to 2100 Hz.
    slope: Set curve slope of low shelf filter. Default is 0.5. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 1.
    level_in: Set input gain. Default is 0.9.
    level_out: Set output gain. Default is 1.
    block_size: Set block size used for reverse IIR processing. If this value is set to high enough value (higher than impulse response length truncated when reaches near zero values) filtering will become linear phase otherwise if not big enough it will just produce nasty artifacts. Note that filter delay will be exactly this many samples when set to non-zero value.

Dynamic Audio Normalizer.

This filter applies a certain amount of gain to the input audio in order
to bring its peak magnitude to a target level (e.g. 0 dBFS). However, in
contrast to more "simple" normalization algorithms, the Dynamic Audio
Normalizer *dynamically* re-adjusts the gain factor to the input audio.
This allows for applying extra gain to the "quiet" sections of the audio
while avoiding distortions or clipping the "loud" sections. In other words:
The Dynamic Audio Normalizer will "even out" the volume of quiet and loud
sections, in the sense that the volume of each section is brought to the
same target level. Note, however, that the Dynamic Audio Normalizer achieves
this goal *without* applying "dynamic range compressing". It will retain 100%
of the dynamic range *within* each section of the audio file.


Args:
    framelen: Set the frame length in milliseconds. In range from 10 to 8000 milliseconds. Default is 500 milliseconds. The Dynamic Audio Normalizer processes the input audio in small chunks, referred to as frames. This is required, because a peak magnitude has no meaning for just a single sample value. Instead, we need to determine the peak magnitude for a contiguous sequence of sample values. While a "standard" normalizer would simply use the peak magnitude of the complete file, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer determines the peak magnitude individually for each frame. The length of a frame is specified in milliseconds. By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer uses a frame length of 500 milliseconds, which has been found to give good results with most files. Note that the exact frame length, in number of samples, will be determined automatically, based on the sampling rate of the individual input audio file.
    gausssize: Set the Gaussian filter window size. In range from 3 to 301, must be odd number. Default is 31. Probably the most important parameter of the Dynamic Audio Normalizer is the window size of the Gaussian smoothing filter. The filter's window size is specified in frames, centered around the current frame. For the sake of simplicity, this must be an odd number. Consequently, the default value of 31 takes into account the current frame, as well as the 15 preceding frames and the 15 subsequent frames. Using a larger window results in a stronger smoothing effect and thus in less gain variation, i.e. slower gain adaptation. Conversely, using a smaller window results in a weaker smoothing effect and thus in more gain variation, i.e. faster gain adaptation. In other words, the more you increase this value, the more the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will behave like a "traditional" normalization filter. On the contrary, the more you decrease this value, the more the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will behave like a dynamic range compressor.
    peak: Set the target peak value. This specifies the highest permissible magnitude level for the normalized audio input. This filter will try to approach the target peak magnitude as closely as possible, but at the same time it also makes sure that the normalized signal will never exceed the peak magnitude. A frame's maximum local gain factor is imposed directly by the target peak magnitude. The default value is 0.95 and thus leaves a headroom of 5%*. It is not recommended to go above this value.
    maxgain: Set the maximum gain factor. In range from 1.0 to 100.0. Default is 10.0. The Dynamic Audio Normalizer determines the maximum possible (local) gain factor for each input frame, i.e. the maximum gain factor that does not result in clipping or distortion. The maximum gain factor is determined by the frame's highest magnitude sample. However, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer additionally bounds the frame's maximum gain factor by a predetermined (global) maximum gain factor. This is done in order to avoid excessive gain factors in "silent" or almost silent frames. By default, the maximum gain factor is 10.0, For most inputs the default value should be sufficient and it usually is not recommended to increase this value. Though, for input with an extremely low overall volume level, it may be necessary to allow even higher gain factors. Note, however, that the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does not simply apply a "hard" threshold (i.e. cut off values above the threshold). Instead, a "sigmoid" threshold function will be applied. This way, the gain factors will smoothly approach the threshold value, but never exceed that value.
    targetrms: Set the target RMS. In range from 0.0 to 1.0. Default is 0.0 - disabled. By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer performs "peak" normalization. This means that the maximum local gain factor for each frame is defined (only) by the frame's highest magnitude sample. This way, the samples can be amplified as much as possible without exceeding the maximum signal level, i.e. without clipping. Optionally, however, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer can also take into account the frame's root mean square, abbreviated RMS. In electrical engineering, the RMS is commonly used to determine the power of a time-varying signal. It is therefore considered that the RMS is a better approximation of the "perceived loudness" than just looking at the signal's peak magnitude. Consequently, by adjusting all frames to a constant RMS value, a uniform "perceived loudness" can be established. If a target RMS value has been specified, a frame's local gain factor is defined as the factor that would result in exactly that RMS value. Note, however, that the maximum local gain factor is still restricted by the frame's highest magnitude sample, in order to prevent clipping.
    coupling: Enable channels coupling. By default is enabled. By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will amplify all channels by the same amount. This means the same gain factor will be applied to all channels, i.e. the maximum possible gain factor is determined by the "loudest" channel. However, in some recordings, it may happen that the volume of the different channels is uneven, e.g. one channel may be "quieter" than the other one(s). In this case, this option can be used to disable the channel coupling. This way, the gain factor will be determined independently for each channel, depending only on the individual channel's highest magnitude sample. This allows for harmonizing the volume of the different channels.
    correctdc: Enable DC bias correction. By default is disabled. An audio signal (in the time domain) is a sequence of sample values. In the Dynamic Audio Normalizer these sample values are represented in the -1.0 to 1.0 range, regardless of the original input format. Normally, the audio signal, or "waveform", should be centered around the zero point. That means if we calculate the mean value of all samples in a file, or in a single frame, then the result should be 0.0 or at least very close to that value. If, however, there is a significant deviation of the mean value from 0.0, in either positive or negative direction, this is referred to as a DC bias or DC offset. Since a DC bias is clearly undesirable, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer provides optional DC bias correction. With DC bias correction enabled, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will determine the mean value, or "DC correction" offset, of each input frame and subtract that value from all of the frame's sample values which ensures those samples are centered around 0.0 again. Also, in order to avoid "gaps" at the frame boundaries, the DC correction offset values will be interpolated smoothly between neighbouring frames.
    altboundary: Enable alternative boundary mode. By default is disabled. The Dynamic Audio Normalizer takes into account a certain neighbourhood around each frame. This includes the preceding frames as well as the subsequent frames. However, for the "boundary" frames, located at the very beginning and at the very end of the audio file, not all neighbouring frames are available. In particular, for the first few frames in the audio file, the preceding frames are not known. And, similarly, for the last few frames in the audio file, the subsequent frames are not known. Thus, the question arises which gain factors should be assumed for the missing frames in the "boundary" region. The Dynamic Audio Normalizer implements two modes to deal with this situation. The default boundary mode assumes a gain factor of exactly 1.0 for the missing frames, resulting in a smooth "fade in" and "fade out" at the beginning and at the end of the input, respectively.
    compress: Set the compress factor. In range from 0.0 to 30.0. Default is 0.0. By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does not apply "traditional" compression. This means that signal peaks will not be pruned and thus the full dynamic range will be retained within each local neighbourhood. However, in some cases it may be desirable to combine the Dynamic Audio Normalizer's normalization algorithm with a more "traditional" compression. For this purpose, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer provides an optional compression (thresholding) function. If (and only if) the compression feature is enabled, all input frames will be processed by a soft knee thresholding function prior to the actual normalization process. Put simply, the thresholding function is going to prune all samples whose magnitude exceeds a certain threshold value. However, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does not simply apply a fixed threshold value. Instead, the threshold value will be adjusted for each individual frame. In general, smaller parameters result in stronger compression, and vice versa. Values below 3.0 are not recommended, because audible distortion may appear.
    threshold: Set the target threshold value. This specifies the lowest permissible magnitude level for the audio input which will be normalized. If input frame volume is above this value frame will be normalized. Otherwise frame may not be normalized at all. The default value is set to 0, which means all input frames will be normalized. This option is mostly useful if digital noise is not wanted to be amplified.
    channels: Specify which channels to filter, by default all available channels are filtered.
    overlap: Specify overlap for frames. If set to 0 (default) no frame overlapping is done. Using >0 and <1 values will make less conservative gain adjustments, like when framelen option is set to smaller value, if framelen option value is compensated for non-zero overlap then gain adjustments will be smoother across time compared to zero overlap case.

EBU R128 scanner filter. This filter takes an audio stream and analyzes its loudness
level. By default, it logs a message at a frequency of 10Hz with the
Momentary loudness (identified by M), Short-term loudness (S),
Integrated loudness (I) and Loudness Range (LRA).

The filter can only analyze streams which have
sample format is double-precision floating point. The input stream will be converted to
this specification, if needed. Users may need to insert aformat and/or aresample filters
after this filter to obtain the original parameters.

The filter also has a video output (see the video option) with a real
time graph to observe the loudness evolution. The graphic contains the logged
message mentioned above, so it is not printed anymore when this option is set,
unless the verbose logging is set. The main graphing area contains the
short-term loudness (3 seconds of analysis), and the gauge on the right is for
the momentary loudness (400 milliseconds), but can optionally be configured
to instead display short-term loudness (see gauge).

The green area marks a  +/- 1LU target range around the target loudness
(-23LUFS by default, unless modified through target).

More information about the Loudness Recommendation EBU R128 on
http://tech.ebu.ch/loudness.

The filter accepts the following options:


Args:
    video: Activate the video output. The audio stream is passed unchanged whether this option is set or no. The video stream will be the first output stream if activated. Default is 0.
    size: Set the video size. This option is for video only. For the syntax of this option, check the "Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. Default and minimum resolution is 640x480.
    meter: Set the EBU scale meter. Default is 9. Common values are 9 and 18, respectively for EBU scale meter +9 and EBU scale meter +18. Any other integer value between this range is allowed.
    framelog: Force the frame logging level. Available values are: @end table By default, the logging level is set to info. If the video or the metadata options are set, it switches to verbose.
    metadata: Set metadata injection. If set to 1, the audio input will be segmented into 100ms output frames, each of them containing various loudness information in metadata. All the metadata keys are prefixed with lavfi.r128.. Default is 0.
    peak: Set peak mode(s). Available modes can be cumulated (the option is a flag type). Possible values are: @end table
    dualmono: Treat mono input files as "dual mono". If a mono file is intended for playback on a stereo system, its EBU R128 measurement will be perceptually incorrect. If set to true, this option will compensate for this effect. Multi-channel input files are not affected by this option.
    panlaw: Set a specific pan law to be used for the measurement of dual mono files. This parameter is optional, and has a default value of -3.01dB.
    target: Set a specific target level (in LUFS) used as relative zero in the visualization. This parameter is optional and has a default value of -23LUFS as specified by EBU R128. However, material published online may prefer a level of -16LUFS (e.g. for use with podcasts or video platforms).
    gauge: Set the value displayed by the gauge. Valid values are momentary and s shortterm. By default the momentary value will be used, but in certain scenarios it may be more useful to observe the short term value instead (e.g. live mixing).
    scale: Sets the display scale for the loudness. Valid parameters are absolute (in LUFS) or relative (LU) relative to the target. This only affects the video output, not the summary or continuous log output.

Decodes High Definition Compatible Digital (HDCD) data. A 16-bit PCM stream with
embedded HDCD codes is expanded into a 20-bit PCM stream.

The filter supports the Peak Extend and Low-level Gain Adjustment features
of HDCD, and detects the Transient Filter flag.

@example
ffmpeg -i HDCD16.flac -af hdcd OUT24.flac
@end example

When using the filter with wav, note the default encoding for wav is 16-bit,
so the resulting 20-bit stream will be truncated back to 16-bit. Use something
like -acodec pcm_s24le after the filter to get 24-bit PCM output.
@example
ffmpeg -i HDCD16.wav -af hdcd OUT16.wav
ffmpeg -i HDCD16.wav -af hdcd -c:a pcm_s24le OUT24.wav
@end example

The filter accepts the following options:


Args:
    disable_autoconvert: Disable any automatic format conversion or resampling in the filter graph.
    process_stereo: Process the stereo channels together. If target_gain does not match between channels, consider it invalid and use the last valid target_gain.
    cdt_ms: Set the code detect timer period in ms.
    force_pe: Always extend peaks above -3dBFS even if PE isn't signaled.
    analyze_mode: Replace audio with a solid tone and adjust the amplitude to signal some specific aspect of the decoding process. The output file can be loaded in an audio editor alongside the original to aid analysis. analyze_mode=pe:force_pe=true can be used to see all samples above the PE level. Modes are: @end table

EBU R128 loudness normalization. Includes both dynamic and linear normalization modes.
Support for both single pass (livestreams, files) and double pass (files) modes.
This algorithm can target IL, LRA, and maximum true peak. In dynamic mode, to accurately
detect true peaks, the audio stream will be upsampled to 192 kHz.
Use the -ar option or aresample filter to explicitly set an output sample rate.

The filter accepts the following options:


Args:
    I: Set integrated loudness target. Range is -70.0 - -5.0. Default value is -24.0.
    LRA: Set loudness range target. Range is 1.0 - 50.0. Default value is 7.0.
    TP: Set maximum true peak. Range is -9.0 - +0.0. Default value is -2.0.
    measured_I: Measured IL of input file. Range is -99.0 - +0.0.
    measured_LRA: Measured LRA of input file. Range is 0.0 - 99.0.
    measured_TP: Measured true peak of input file. Range is -99.0 - +99.0.
    measured_thresh: Measured threshold of input file. Range is -99.0 - +0.0.
    offset: Set offset gain. Gain is applied before the true-peak limiter. Range is -99.0 - +99.0. Default is +0.0.
    linear: Normalize by linearly scaling the source audio. measured_I, measured_LRA, measured_TP, and measured_thresh must all be specified. Target LRA shouldn't be lower than source LRA and the change in integrated loudness shouldn't result in a true peak which exceeds the target TP. If any of these conditions aren't met, normalization mode will revert to dynamic. Options are true or false. Default is true.
    dual_mono: Treat mono input files as "dual-mono". If a mono file is intended for playback on a stereo system, its EBU R128 measurement will be perceptually incorrect. If set to true, this option will compensate for this effect. Multi-channel input files are not affected by this option. Options are true or false. Default is false.
    print_format: Set print format for stats. Options are summary, json, or none. Default value is none.

logarithmically using Brown-Puckette constant Q transform algorithm with
direct frequency domain coefficient calculation (but the transform itself
is not really constant Q, instead the Q factor is actually variable/clamped),
with musical tone scale, from E0 to D#10.

The filter accepts the following options:


Args:
    size: Specify the video size for the output. It must be even. For the syntax of this option, check the "Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. Default value is 1920x1080.
    fps: Set the output frame rate. Default value is 25.
    bar_h: Set the bargraph height. It must be even. Default value is -1 which computes the bargraph height automatically.
    axis_h: Set the axis height. It must be even. Default value is -1 which computes the axis height automatically.
    sono_h: Set the sonogram height. It must be even. Default value is -1 which computes the sonogram height automatically.
    fullhd: Set the fullhd resolution. This option is deprecated, use size, s instead. Default value is 1.
    sono_v: Specify the sonogram volume expression. It can contain variables: @end table and functions: @end table Default value is 16.
    bar_v: Specify the bargraph volume expression. It can contain variables: @end table and functions: @end table Default value is sono_v.
    sono_g: Specify the sonogram gamma. Lower gamma makes the spectrum more contrast, higher gamma makes the spectrum having more range. Default value is 3. Acceptable range is [1, 7].
    bar_g: Specify the bargraph gamma. Default value is 1. Acceptable range is [1, 7].
    bar_t: Specify the bargraph transparency level. Lower value makes the bargraph sharper. Default value is 1. Acceptable range is [0, 1].
    timeclamp: Specify the transform timeclamp. At low frequency, there is trade-off between accuracy in time domain and frequency domain. If timeclamp is lower, event in time domain is represented more accurately (such as fast bass drum), otherwise event in frequency domain is represented more accurately (such as bass guitar). Acceptable range is [0.002, 1]. Default value is 0.17.
    attack: Set attack time in seconds. The default is 0 (disabled). Otherwise, it limits future samples by applying asymmetric windowing in time domain, useful when low latency is required. Accepted range is [0, 1].
    basefreq: Specify the transform base frequency. Default value is 20.01523126408007475, which is frequency 50 cents below E0. Acceptable range is [10, 100000].
    endfreq: Specify the transform end frequency. Default value is 20495.59681441799654, which is frequency 50 cents above D#10. Acceptable range is [10, 100000].
    coeffclamp: This option is deprecated and ignored.
    tlength: Specify the transform length in time domain. Use this option to control accuracy trade-off between time domain and frequency domain at every frequency sample. It can contain variables: @end table Default value is 384*tc/(384+tc*f).
    count: Specify the transform count for every video frame. Default value is 6. Acceptable range is [1, 30].
    fcount: Specify the transform count for every single pixel. Default value is 0, which makes it computed automatically. Acceptable range is [0, 10].
    fontfile: Specify font file for use with freetype to draw the axis. If not specified, use embedded font. Note that drawing with font file or embedded font is not implemented with custom basefreq and endfreq, use axisfile option instead.
    font: Specify fontconfig pattern. This has lower priority than fontfile. The : in the pattern may be replaced by | to avoid unnecessary escaping.
    fontcolor: Specify font color expression. This is arithmetic expression that should return integer value 0xRRGGBB. It can contain variables: @end table and functions: @end table Default value is st(0, (midi(f)-59.5)/12); st(1, if(between(ld(0),0,1), 0.5-0.5*cos(2*PI*ld(0)), 0)); r(1-ld(1)) + b(ld(1)).
    axisfile: Specify image file to draw the axis. This option override fontfile and fontcolor option.
    axis: Enable/disable drawing text to the axis. If it is set to 0, drawing to the axis is disabled, ignoring fontfile and axisfile option. Default value is 1.
    csp: Set colorspace. The accepted values are: @end table
    cscheme: Set spectrogram color scheme. This is list of floating point values with format left_r|left_g|left_b|right_r|right_g|right_b. The default is 1|0.5|0|0|0.5|1.

This filter acts like normal compressor but has the ability to compress
detected signal using second input signal.
It needs two input streams and returns one output stream.
First input stream will be processed depending on second stream signal.
The filtered signal then can be filtered with other filters in later stages of
processing. See pan and amerge filter.

Args:
    level_in: Set input gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625 and 64.
    mode: Set mode of compressor operation. Can be upward or downward. Default is downward.
    threshold: If a signal of second stream raises above this level it will affect the gain reduction of first stream. By default is 0.125. Range is between 0.00097563 and 1.
    ratio: Set a ratio about which the signal is reduced. 1:2 means that if the level raised 4dB above the threshold, it will be only 2dB above after the reduction. Default is 2. Range is between 1 and 20.
    attack: Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain reduction starts. Default is 20. Range is between 0.01 and 2000.
    release: Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before reduction is decreased again. Default is 250. Range is between 0.01 and 9000.
    makeup: Set the amount by how much signal will be amplified after processing. Default is 1. Range is from 1 to 64.
    knee: Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly. Default is 2.82843. Range is between 1 and 8.
    link: Choose if the average level between all channels of side-chain stream or the louder(maximum) channel of side-chain stream affects the reduction. Default is average.
    detection: Should the exact signal be taken in case of peak or an RMS one in case of rms. Default is rms which is mainly smoother.
    level_sc: Set sidechain gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625 and 64.

A sidechain gate acts like a normal (wideband) gate but has the ability to
filter the detected signal before sending it to the gain reduction stage.
Normally a gate uses the full range signal to detect a level above the
threshold.
For example: If you cut all lower frequencies from your sidechain signal
the gate will decrease the volume of your track only if not enough highs
appear. With this technique you are able to reduce the resonation of a
natural drum or remove "rumbling" of muted strokes from a heavily distorted
guitar.
It needs two input streams and returns one output stream.
First input stream will be processed depending on second stream signal.

The filter accepts the following options:


Args:
    level_in: Set input level before filtering. Default is 1. Allowed range is from 0.015625 to 64.
    mode: Set the mode of operation. Can be upward or downward. Default is downward. If set to upward mode, higher parts of signal will be amplified, expanding dynamic range in upward direction. Otherwise, in case of downward lower parts of signal will be reduced.
    range: Set the level of gain reduction when the signal is below the threshold. Default is 0.06125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1. Setting this to 0 disables reduction and then filter behaves like expander.
    threshold: If a signal rises above this level the gain reduction is released. Default is 0.125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.
    ratio: Set a ratio about which the signal is reduced. Default is 2. Allowed range is from 1 to 9000.
    attack: Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain reduction stops. Default is 20 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.

    makeup: Set amount of amplification of signal after processing. Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 64.
    knee: Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly. Default is 2.828427125. Allowed range is from 1 to 8.
    detection: Choose if exact signal should be taken for detection or an RMS like one. Default is rms. Can be peak or rms.
    link: Choose if the average level between all channels or the louder channel affects the reduction. Default is average. Can be average or maximum.

Detect silence in an audio stream.

This filter logs a message when it detects that the input audio volume is less
or equal to a noise tolerance value for a duration greater or equal to the
minimum detected noise duration.

The printed times and duration are expressed in seconds. The
lavfi.silence_start or lavfi.silence_start.X metadata key
is set on the first frame whose timestamp equals or exceeds the detection
duration and it contains the timestamp of the first frame of the silence.

The lavfi.silence_duration or lavfi.silence_duration.X
and lavfi.silence_end or lavfi.silence_end.X metadata
keys are set on the first frame after the silence. If mono is
enabled, and each channel is evaluated separately, the .X
suffixed keys are used, and X corresponds to the channel number.

The filter accepts the following options:


Args:
    n: Set noise tolerance. Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the specified value) or amplitude ratio. Default is -60dB, or 0.001.

Remove silence from the beginning, middle or end of the audio.

The filter accepts the following options:


Args:
    start_periods: This value is used to indicate if audio should be trimmed at beginning of the audio. A value of zero indicates no silence should be trimmed from the beginning. When specifying a non-zero value, it trims audio up until it finds non-silence. Normally, when trimming silence from beginning of audio the start_periods will be 1 but it can be increased to higher values to trim all audio up to specific count of non-silence periods. Default value is 0.
    start_duration: Specify the amount of time that non-silence must be detected before it stops trimming audio. By increasing the duration, bursts of noises can be treated as silence and trimmed off. Default value is 0.
    start_threshold: This indicates what sample value should be treated as silence. For digital audio, a value of 0 may be fine but for audio recorded from analog, you may wish to increase the value to account for background noise. Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the specified value) or amplitude ratio. Default value is 0.
    start_silence: Specify max duration of silence at beginning that will be kept after trimming. Default is 0, which is equal to trimming all samples detected as silence.
    start_mode: Specify mode of detection of silence end in start of multi-channel audio. Can be any or all. Default is any. With any, any sample that is detected as non-silence will cause stopped trimming of silence. With all, only if all channels are detected as non-silence will cause stopped trimming of silence.
    stop_periods: Set the count for trimming silence from the end of audio. To remove silence from the middle of a file, specify a stop_periods that is negative. This value is then treated as a positive value and is used to indicate the effect should restart processing as specified by start_periods, making it suitable for removing periods of silence in the middle of the audio. Default value is 0.
    stop_duration: Specify a duration of silence that must exist before audio is not copied any more. By specifying a higher duration, silence that is wanted can be left in the audio. Default value is 0.
    stop_threshold: This is the same as start_threshold but for trimming silence from the end of audio. Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the specified value) or amplitude ratio. Default value is 0.
    stop_silence: Specify max duration of silence at end that will be kept after trimming. Default is 0, which is equal to trimming all samples detected as silence.
    stop_mode: Specify mode of detection of silence start in end of multi-channel audio. Can be any or all. Default is any. With any, any sample that is detected as non-silence will cause stopped trimming of silence. With all, only if all channels are detected as non-silence will cause stopped trimming of silence.
    detection: Set how is silence detected. Can be rms or peak. Second is faster and works better with digital silence which is exactly 0. Default value is rms.
    window: Set duration in number of seconds used to calculate size of window in number of samples for detecting silence. Default value is 0.02. Allowed range is from 0 to 10.

Speech Normalizer.

This filter expands or compresses each half-cycle of audio samples
(local set of samples all above or all below zero and between two nearest zero crossings) depending
on threshold value, so audio reaches target peak value under conditions controlled by below options.

The filter accepts the following options:


Args:
    peak: Set the expansion target peak value. This specifies the highest allowed absolute amplitude level for the normalized audio input. Default value is 0.95. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 1.0.
    expansion: Set the maximum expansion factor. Allowed range is from 1.0 to 50.0. Default value is 2.0. This option controls maximum local half-cycle of samples expansion. The maximum expansion would be such that local peak value reaches target peak value but never to surpass it and that ratio between new and previous peak value does not surpass this option value.
    compression: Set the maximum compression factor. Allowed range is from 1.0 to 50.0. Default value is 2.0. This option controls maximum local half-cycle of samples compression. This option is used only if threshold option is set to value greater than 0.0, then in such cases when local peak is lower or same as value set by threshold all samples belonging to that peak's half-cycle will be compressed by current compression factor.
    threshold: Set the threshold value. Default value is 0.0. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 1.0. This option specifies which half-cycles of samples will be compressed and which will be expanded. Any half-cycle samples with their local peak value below or same as this option value will be compressed by current compression factor, otherwise, if greater than threshold value they will be expanded with expansion factor so that it could reach peak target value but never surpass it.
    _raise: Set the expansion raising amount per each half-cycle of samples. Default value is 0.001. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 1.0. This controls how fast expansion factor is raised per each new half-cycle until it reaches expansion value. Setting this options too high may lead to distortions.
    fall: Set the compression raising amount per each half-cycle of samples. Default value is 0.001. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 1.0. This controls how fast compression factor is raised per each new half-cycle until it reaches compression value.
    channels: Specify which channels to filter, by default all available channels are filtered.
    invert: Enable inverted filtering, by default is disabled. This inverts interpretation of threshold option. When enabled any half-cycle of samples with their local peak value below or same as threshold option will be expanded otherwise it will be compressed.
    link: Link channels when calculating gain applied to each filtered channel sample, by default is disabled. When disabled each filtered channel gain calculation is independent, otherwise when this option is enabled the minimum of all possible gains for each filtered channel is used.
