  "description": "### 11.271 vaguedenoiser\n\nApply a wavelet based denoiser.\n\n\nIt transforms each frame from the video input into the wavelet domain,\nusing Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau 9/7. Then it applies some filtering to\nthe obtained coefficients. It does an inverse wavelet transform after.\nDue to wavelet properties, it should give a nice smoothed result, and\nreduced noise, without blurring picture features.\n\n\nThis filter accepts the following options:\n\n\n- **`threshold`**\n  - The filtering strength. The higher, the more filtered the video will be.\nHard thresholding can use a higher threshold than soft thresholding\nbefore the video looks overfiltered. Default value is 2.\n- **`method`**\n  - The filtering method the filter will use.\nIt accepts the following values:\n\u2018\nhard\n\u2019\nAll values under the threshold will be zeroed.\n\u2018\nsoft\n\u2019\nAll values under the threshold will be zeroed. All values above will be\nreduced by the threshold.\n\u2018\ngarrote\n\u2019\nScales or nullifies coefficients - intermediary between (more) soft and\n(less) hard thresholding.\nDefault is garrote.\n- **`nsteps`**\n  - Number of times, the wavelet will decompose the picture. Picture can\u2019t\nbe decomposed beyond a particular point (typically, 8 for a 640x480\nframe - as 2^9 = 512 > 480). Valid values are integers between 1 and 32. Default value is 6.\n- **`percent`**\n  - Partial of full denoising (limited coefficients shrinking), from 0 to 100. Default value is 85.\n- **`planes`**\n  - A list of the planes to process. By default all planes are processed.\n- **`type`**\n  - The threshold type the filter will use.\nIt accepts the following values:\n\u2018\nuniversal\n\u2019\nThreshold used is same for all decompositions.\n\u2018\nbayes\n\u2019\nThreshold used depends also on each decomposition coefficients.\nDefault is universal.\nThe filtering strength.
