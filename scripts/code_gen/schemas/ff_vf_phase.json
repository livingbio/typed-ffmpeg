  "description": "### 11.190 phase\n\nDelay interlaced video by one field time so that the field order changes.\n\nThe intended use is to fix PAL movies that have been captured with the\nopposite field order to the film-to-video transfer.\n\nA description of the accepted parameters follows.\n\n**mode**\n\n    Set phase mode. It accepts the following values: \u2018t\u2019 Capture field order top-first, transfer bottom-first. Filter will delay the bottom field. \u2018b\u2019 Capture field order bottom-first, transfer top-first. Filter will delay the top field. \u2018p\u2019 Capture and transfer with the same field order. This mode only exists for the documentation of the other options to refer to, but if you actually select it, the filter will faithfully do nothing. \u2018a\u2019 Capture field order determined automatically by field flags, transfer opposite. Filter selects among \u2018t\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 modes on a frame by frame basis using field flags. If no field information is available, then this works just like \u2018u\u2019. \u2018u\u2019 Capture unknown or varying, transfer opposite. Filter selects among \u2018t\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 on a frame by frame basis by analyzing the images and selecting the alternative that produces best match between the fields. \u2018T\u2019 Capture top-first, transfer unknown or varying. Filter selects among \u2018t\u2019 and \u2018p\u2019 using image analysis. \u2018B\u2019 Capture bottom-first, transfer unknown or varying. Filter selects among \u2018b\u2019 and \u2018p\u2019 using image analysis. \u2018A\u2019 Capture determined by field flags, transfer unknown or varying. Filter selects among \u2018t\u2019, \u2018b\u2019 and \u2018p\u2019 using field flags and image analysis. If no field information is available, then this works just like \u2018U\u2019. This is the default mode. \u2018U\u2019 Both capture and transfer unknown or varying. Filter selects among \u2018t\u2019, \u2018b\u2019 and \u2018p\u2019 using image analysis only. \n\n",
