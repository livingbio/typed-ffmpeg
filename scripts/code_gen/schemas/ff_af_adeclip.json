Allowed range is from\n10\nto\n100\n.\nDefault value is\n55\nmilliseconds.\nThis sets size of window which will be processed at once.\n- **`overlap, o`**\n  - Set window overlap, in percentage of window size. Allowed range is from\n50\nto\n95\n. Default value is\n75\npercent.\n- **`arorder, a`**\n  - Set autoregression order, in percentage of window size. Allowed range is from\n0\nto\n25\n. Default value is\n8\npercent. This option also controls\nquality of interpolated samples using neighbour good samples.\n- **`threshold, t`**\n  - Set threshold value. Allowed range is from\n1\nto\n100\n.\nDefault value is\n10\n. Higher values make clip detection less aggressive.\n- **`hsize, n`**\n  - Set size of histogram used to detect clips. Allowed range is from\n100\nto\n9999\n.\nDefault value is\n1000\n. Higher values make clip detection less aggressive.\n- **`method, m`**\n  - Set overlap method.\nIt accepts the following values:\nadd, a\nSelect overlap-add method. Even not interpolated samples are slightly changed\nwith this method.\nsave, s\nSelect overlap-save method.

This option also controls\nquality of interpolated samples using neighbour good samples.\n\n\nSet threshold value. Allowed range is from 1 to 100.\nDefault value is 10.
