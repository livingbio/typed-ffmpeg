  "description": "### 8.108 silenceremove\n\nRemove silence from the beginning, middle or end of the audio.\n\n\nThe filter accepts the following options:\n\n\n- **`start_periods`**\n  - This value is used to indicate if audio should be trimmed at beginning of\nthe audio. A value of zero indicates no silence should be trimmed from the\nbeginning. When specifying a non-zero value, it trims audio up until it\nfinds non-silence. Normally, when trimming silence from beginning of audio\nthe\nstart_periods\nwill be\n1\nbut it can be increased to higher\nvalues to trim all audio up to specific count of non-silence periods.\nDefault value is\n0\n.\n- **`start_duration`**\n  - Specify the amount of time that non-silence must be detected before it stops\ntrimming audio. By increasing the duration, bursts of noises can be treated\nas silence and trimmed off. Default value is\n0\n.\n- **`start_threshold`**\n  - This indicates what sample value should be treated as silence. For digital\naudio, a value of\n0\nmay be fine but for audio recorded from analog,\nyou may wish to increase the value to account for background noise.\nCan be specified in dB (in case \"dB\" is appended to the specified value)\nor amplitude ratio. Default value is\n0\n.\n- **`start_silence`**\n  - Specify max duration of silence at beginning that will be kept after\ntrimming. Default is 0, which is equal to trimming all samples detected\nas silence.\n- **`start_mode`**\n  - Specify mode of detection of silence end at start of multi-channel audio.\nCan be\nany\nor\nall\n. Default is\nany\n.\nWith\nany\n, any sample from any channel that is detected as non-silence\nwill trigger end of silence trimming at start of audio stream.\nWith\nall\n, only if every sample from every channel is detected as non-silence\nwill trigger end of silence trimming at start of audio stream, limited usage.\n- **`stop_periods`**\n  - Set the count for trimming silence from the end of audio. When specifying a\npositive value, it trims audio after it finds specified silence period.\nTo remove silence from the middle of a file, specify a\nstop_periods\nthat is negative. This value is then treated as a positive value and is\nused to indicate the effect should restart processing as specified by\nstop_periods\n, making it suitable for removing periods of silence\nin the middle of the audio.\nDefault value is\n0\n.\n- **`stop_duration`**\n  - Specify a duration of silence that must exist before audio is not copied any\nmore. By specifying a higher duration, silence that is wanted can be left in\nthe audio.\nDefault value is\n0\n.\n- **`stop_threshold`**\n  - This is the same as\nstart_threshold\nbut for trimming silence from\nthe end of audio.\nCan be specified in dB (in case \"dB\" is appended to the specified value)\nor amplitude ratio. Default value is\n0\n.\n- **`stop_silence`**\n  - Specify max duration of silence at end that will be kept after\ntrimming. Default is 0, which is equal to trimming all samples detected\nas silence.\n- **`stop_mode`**\n  - Specify mode of detection of silence start after start of multi-channel audio.\nCan be\nany\nor\nall\n. Default is\nall\n.\nWith\nany\n, any sample from any channel that is detected as silence\nwill trigger start of silence trimming after start of audio stream, limited usage.\nWith\nall\n, only if every sample from every channel is detected as silence\nwill trigger start of silence trimming after start of audio stream.\n- **`detection`**\n  - Set how is silence detected.\navg\nMean of absolute values of samples in moving window.\nrms\nRoot squared mean of absolute values of samples in moving window.\npeak\nMaximum of absolute values of samples in moving window.\nmedian\nMedian of absolute values of samples in moving window.\nptp\nAbsolute of max peak to min peak difference of samples in moving window.\ndev\nStandard deviation of values of samples in moving window.\nDefault value is\nrms\n.\n- **`window`**\n  - Set duration in number of seconds used to calculate size of window in number\nof samples for detecting silence. Using\n0\nwill effectively disable\nany windowing and use only single sample per channel for silence detection.\nIn that case it may be needed to also set\nstart_silence\nand/or\nstop_silence\nto nonzero values with also\nstart_duration\nand/or\nstop_duration\nto nonzero values.\nDefault value is\n0.02\n. Allowed range is from\n0\nto\n10\n.\n- **`timestamp`**\n  - Set processing mode of every audio frame output timestamp.\nwrite\nFull timestamps rewrite, keep only the start time for the first output frame.\ncopy\nNon-dropped frames are left with same timestamp as input audio frame.\nDefaults value is\nwrite\n.\nThis value is used to indicate if audio should be trimmed at beginning of\nthe audio.
