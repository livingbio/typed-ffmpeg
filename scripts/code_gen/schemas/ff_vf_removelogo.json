  "description": "11.208 removelogo\nSuppress a TV station logo, using an image file to determine which\npixels comprise the logo. It works by filling in the pixels that\ncomprise the logo with neighboring pixels.\n\nThe filter accepts the following options:\n\n\nPixels in the provided bitmap image with a value of zero are not\nconsidered part of the logo, non-zero pixels are considered part of\nthe logo. If you use white (255) for the logo and black (0) for the\nrest, you will be safe. For making the filter bitmap, it is\nrecommended to take a screen capture of a black frame with the logo\nvisible, and then using a threshold filter followed by the erode\nfilter once or twice.\n\nIf needed, little splotches can be fixed manually. Remember that if\nlogo pixels are not covered, the filter quality will be much\nreduced. Marking too many pixels as part of the logo does not hurt as\nmuch, but it will increase the amount of blurring needed to cover over\nthe image and will destroy more information than necessary, and extra\npixels will slow things down on a large logo.",
