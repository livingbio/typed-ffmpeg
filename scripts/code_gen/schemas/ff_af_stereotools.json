  "description": "### 8.111 stereotools\n\nThis filter has some handy utilities to manage stereo signals, for converting\nM/S stereo recordings to L/R signal while having control over the parameters\nor spreading the stereo image of master track.\n\n\nThe filter accepts the following options:\n\n\n- **`level_in`**\n  - Set input level before filtering for both channels. Defaults is 1.\nAllowed range is from 0.015625 to 64.\n- **`level_out`**\n  - Set output level after filtering for both channels. Defaults is 1.\nAllowed range is from 0.015625 to 64.\n- **`balance_in`**\n  - Set input balance between both channels. Default is 0.\nAllowed range is from -1 to 1.\n- **`balance_out`**\n  - Set output balance between both channels. Default is 0.\nAllowed range is from -1 to 1.\n- **`softclip`**\n  - Enable softclipping. Results in analog distortion instead of harsh digital 0dB\nclipping. Disabled by default.\n- **`mutel`**\n  - Mute the left channel. Disabled by default.\n- **`muter`**\n  - Mute the right channel. Disabled by default.\n- **`phasel`**\n  - Change the phase of the left channel. Disabled by default.\n- **`phaser`**\n  - Change the phase of the right channel. Disabled by default.\n- **`mode`**\n  - Set stereo mode. Available values are:\n\u2018\nlr>lr\n\u2019\nLeft/Right to Left/Right, this is default.\n\u2018\nlr>ms\n\u2019\nLeft/Right to Mid/Side.\n\u2018\nms>lr\n\u2019\nMid/Side to Left/Right.\n\u2018\nlr>ll\n\u2019\nLeft/Right to Left/Left.\n\u2018\nlr>rr\n\u2019\nLeft/Right to Right/Right.\n\u2018\nlr>l+r\n\u2019\nLeft/Right to Left + Right.\n\u2018\nlr>rl\n\u2019\nLeft/Right to Right/Left.\n\u2018\nms>ll\n\u2019\nMid/Side to Left/Left.\n\u2018\nms>rr\n\u2019\nMid/Side to Right/Right.\n\u2018\nms>rl\n\u2019\nMid/Side to Right/Left.\n\u2018\nlr>l-r\n\u2019\nLeft/Right to Left - Right.\n- **`slev`**\n  - Set level of side signal.

Default is 1.\nAllowed range is from 0.015625 to 64.\n- **`mpan`**\n  - Set middle signal pan. Default is 0. Allowed range is from -1 to 1.\n- **`base`**\n  - Set stereo base between mono and inversed channels. Default is 0.\nAllowed range is from -1 to 1.\n- **`delay`**\n  - Set delay in milliseconds how much to delay left from right channel and\nvice versa. Default is 0. Allowed range is from -20 to 20.\n- **`sclevel`**\n  - Set S/C level. Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 100.\n- **`phase`**\n  - Set the stereo phase in degrees. Default is 0. Allowed range is from 0 to 360.\n- **`bmode_in, bmode_out`**\n  - Set balance mode for balance_in/balance_out option.\nCan be one of the following:\n\u2018\nbalance\n\u2019\nClassic balance mode.
