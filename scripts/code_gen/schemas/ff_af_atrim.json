I.e. the audio\nsample with the timestamp\nstart\nwill be the first sample in the output.\n- **`end`**\n  - Specify time of the first audio sample that will be dropped, i.e. the\naudio sample immediately preceding the one with the timestamp\nend\nwill be\nthe last sample in the output.\n- **`start_pts`**\n  - Same as\nstart\n, except this option sets the start timestamp in samples\ninstead of seconds.\n- **`end_pts`**\n  - Same as\nend\n, except this option sets the end timestamp in samples instead\nof seconds.\n- **`duration`**\n  - The maximum duration of the output in seconds.\n- **`start_sample`**\n  - The number of the first sample that should be output.\n- **`end_sample`**\n  - The number of the first sample that should be dropped.\nTimestamp (in seconds) of the start of the section to keep. I.e. the audio\nsample with the timestamp start will be the first sample in the output.\n\n\nSpecify time of the first audio sample that will be dropped, i.e. the\naudio sample immediately preceding the one with the timestamp end will be\nthe last sample in the output.\n\n\nSame as start, except this option sets the start timestamp in samples\ninstead of seconds.\n\n\nSame as end, except this option sets the end timestamp in samples instead\nof seconds.\n\n\nThe maximum duration of the output in seconds.\n\n\nThe number of the first sample that should be output.\n\n\nThe number of the first sample that should be dropped.\n\n\nstart, end, and duration are expressed as time\nduration specifications; see\n(ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual.\n\n\nNote that the first two sets of the start/end options and the duration\noption look at the frame timestamp, while the _sample options simply count the\nsamples that pass through the filter. So start/end_pts and start/end_sample will\ngive different results when the timestamps are wrong, inexact or do not start at\nzero. Also note that this filter does not modify the timestamps. If you wish\nto have the output timestamps start at zero, insert the asetpts filter after the\natrim filter.\n\n\nIf multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries to be greedy and\nkeep all samples that match at least one of the specified constraints. To keep\nonly the part that matches all the constraints at once, chain multiple atrim\nfilters.\n\n\nThe defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is possible to set e.g.\njust the end values to keep everything before the specified time.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n",
