  "description": "### 18.19 setpts, asetpts\n\nChange the PTS (presentation timestamp) of the input frames.\n\n`setpts` works on video frames, `asetpts` on audio frames.\n\nThis filter accepts the following options:\n\n**expr**\n\n    The expression which is evaluated for each frame to construct its timestamp. \n\nThe expression is evaluated through the eval API and can contain the following\nconstants:\n\n**FRAME_RATE, FR**\n\n    frame rate, only defined for constant frame-rate video \n\n**PTS**\n\n    The presentation timestamp in input \n\n**N**\n\n    The count of the input frame for video or the number of consumed samples, not including the current frame for audio, starting from 0. \n\n**NB_CONSUMED_SAMPLES**\n\n    The number of consumed samples, not including the current frame (only audio) \n\n**NB_SAMPLES, S**\n\n    The number of samples in the current frame (only audio) \n\n**SAMPLE_RATE, SR**\n\n    The audio sample rate. \n\n**STARTPTS**\n\n    The PTS of the first frame. \n\n**STARTT**\n\n    the time in seconds of the first frame \n\n**INTERLACED**\n\n    State whether the current frame is interlaced. \n\n**T**\n\n    the time in seconds of the current frame \n\n**POS**\n\n    original position in the file of the frame, or undefined if undefined for the current frame; deprecated, do not use \n\n**PREV_INPTS**\n\n    The previous input PTS. \n\n**PREV_INT**\n\n    previous input time in seconds \n\n**PREV_OUTPTS**\n\n    The previous output PTS. \n\n**PREV_OUTT**\n\n    previous output time in seconds \n\n**RTCTIME**\n\n    The wallclock (RTC) time in microseconds. This is deprecated, use time(0) instead. \n\n**RTCSTART**\n\n    The wallclock (RTC) time at the start of the movie in microseconds. \n\n**TB**\n\n    The timebase of the input timestamps. \n\n**T_CHANGE**\n\n    Time of the first frame after command was applied or time of the first frame if no commands. \n\n",
