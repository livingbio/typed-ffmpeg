  "description": "### 11.56 dctdnoiz\n\nDenoise frames using 2D DCT (frequency domain filtering).\n\n\nThis filter is not designed for real time.\n\n\nThe filter accepts the following options:\n\n\n- **`sigma, s`**\n  - Set the noise sigma constant.\nThis\nsigma\ndefines a hard threshold of\n3 * sigma\n; every DCT\ncoefficient (absolute value) below this threshold with be dropped.\nIf you need a more advanced filtering, see\nexpr\n.\nDefault is\n0\n.\n- **`overlap`**\n  - Set number overlapping pixels for each block. Since the filter can be slow, you\nmay want to reduce this value, at the cost of a less effective filter and the\nrisk of various artefacts.\nIf the overlapping value doesn\u2019t permit processing the whole input width or\nheight, a warning will be displayed and according borders won\u2019t be denoised.\nDefault value is\nblocksize\n-1, which is the best possible setting.\n- **`expr, e`**\n  - Set the coefficient factor expression.\nFor each coefficient of a DCT block, this expression will be evaluated as a\nmultiplier value for the coefficient.\nIf this is option is set, the\nsigma\noption will be ignored.\nThe absolute value of the coefficient can be accessed through the\nc\nvariable.\n- **`n`**\n  - Set the\nblocksize\nusing the number of bits.\n1<<\nn\ndefines the\nblocksize\n, which is the width and height of the processed blocks.\nThe default value is\n3\n(8x8) and can be raised to\n4\nfor a\nblocksize\nof 16x16. Note that changing this setting has huge consequences\non the speed processing. Also, a larger block size does not necessarily means a\nbetter de-noising.\nSet the noise sigma constant.\n\n\nThis sigma defines a hard threshold of 3 * sigma; every DCT\ncoefficient (absolute value) below this threshold with be dropped.\n\n\nIf you need a more advanced filtering, see expr.\n\n\nDefault is 0.\n\n\nSet number overlapping pixels for each block.
