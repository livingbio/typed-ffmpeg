  "description": "### 11.56 dctdnoiz\n\nDenoise frames using 2D DCT (frequency domain filtering).\n\nThis filter is not designed for real time.\n\nThe filter accepts the following options:\n\n**sigma, s**\n\n    Set the noise sigma constant. This sigma defines a hard threshold of 3 * sigma; every DCT coefficient (absolute value) below this threshold with be dropped. If you need a more advanced filtering, see expr. Default is 0. \n\n**overlap**\n\n    Set number overlapping pixels for each block. Since the filter can be slow, you may want to reduce this value, at the cost of a less effective filter and the risk of various artefacts. If the overlapping value doesn\u2019t permit processing the whole input width or height, a warning will be displayed and according borders won\u2019t be denoised. Default value is blocksize-1, which is the best possible setting. \n\n**expr, e**\n\n    Set the coefficient factor expression. For each coefficient of a DCT block, this expression will be evaluated as a multiplier value for the coefficient. If this is option is set, the sigma option will be ignored. The absolute value of the coefficient can be accessed through the c variable. \n\n**n**\n\n    Set the blocksize using the number of bits. 1<<n defines the blocksize, which is the width and height of the processed blocks. The default value is 3 (8x8) and can be raised to 4 for a blocksize of 16x16. Note that changing this setting has huge consequences on the speed processing. Also, a larger block size does not necessarily means a better de-noising. \n\n",
