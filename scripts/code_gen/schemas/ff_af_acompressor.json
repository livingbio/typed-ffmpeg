  "description": "8.2 acompressor\nA compressor is mainly used to reduce the dynamic range of a signal.\nEspecially modern music is mostly compressed at a high ratio to\nimprove the overall loudness. It\u2019s done to get the highest attention\nof a listener, \"fatten\" the sound and bring more \"power\" to the track.\nIf a signal is compressed too much it may sound dull or \"dead\"\nafterwards or it may start to \"pump\" (which could be a powerful effect\nbut can also destroy a track completely).\nThe right compression is the key to reach a professional sound and is\nthe high art of mixing and mastering. Because of its complex settings\nit may take a long time to get the right feeling for this kind of effect.\n\nCompression is done by detecting the volume above a chosen level\nthreshold and dividing it by the factor set with ratio.\nSo if you set the threshold to -12dB and your signal reaches -6dB a ratio\nof 2:1 will result in a signal at -9dB. Because an exact manipulation of\nthe signal would cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be\nlevelled over the time. This is done by setting \"Attack\" and \"Release\".\nattack determines how long the signal has to rise above the threshold\nbefore any reduction will occur and release sets the time the signal\nhas to fall below the threshold to reduce the reduction again. Shorter signals\nthan the chosen attack time will be left untouched.\nThe overall reduction of the signal can be made up afterwards with the\nmakeup setting. So compressing the peaks of a signal about 6dB and\nraising the makeup to this level results in a signal twice as loud than the\nsource. To gain a softer entry in the compression the knee flattens the\nhard edge at the threshold in the range of the chosen decibels.\n\nThe filter accepts the following options:",
