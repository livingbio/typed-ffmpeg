  "description": "### 11.64 dejudder\n\nRemove judder produced by partially interlaced telecined content.\n\n\nJudder can be introduced, for instance, by pullup filter. If the original\nsource was partially telecined content then the output of pullup,dejudder\nwill have a variable frame rate. May change the recorded frame rate of the\ncontainer. Aside from that change, this filter will not affect constant frame\nrate video.\n\n\nThe option available in this filter is:\n\n\n- **`cycle`**\n  - Specify the length of the window over which the judder repeats.\nAccepts any integer greater than 1. Useful values are:\n\u2018\n4\n\u2019\nIf the original was telecined from 24 to 30 fps (Film to NTSC).\n\u2018\n5\n\u2019\nIf the original was telecined from 25 to 30 fps (PAL to NTSC).\n\u2018\n20\n\u2019\nIf a mixture of the two.\nThe default is \u2018\n4\n\u2019.\nSpecify the length of the window over which the judder repeats.\n\n\nAccepts any integer greater than 1. Useful values are:\n\n\n- **`\u20184\u2019`**\n  - If the original was telecined from 24 to 30 fps (Film to NTSC).\n- **`\u20185\u2019`**\n  - If the original was telecined from 25 to 30 fps (PAL to NTSC).\n- **`\u201820\u2019`**\n  - If a mixture of the two.\nIf the original was telecined from 24 to 30 fps (Film to NTSC).\n\n\nIf the original was telecined from 25 to 30 fps (PAL to NTSC).\n\n\nIf a mixture of the two.\n\n\nThe default is \u20184\u2019.\n\n\n",
