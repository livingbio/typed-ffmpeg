  "description": "11.94 fieldmatch\nField matching filter for inverse telecine. It is meant to reconstruct the\nprogressive frames from a telecined stream. The filter does not drop duplicated\nframes, so to achieve a complete inverse telecine fieldmatch needs to be\nfollowed by a decimation filter such as decimate in the filtergraph.\n\nThe separation of the field matching and the decimation is notably motivated by\nthe possibility of inserting a de-interlacing filter fallback between the two.\nIf the source has mixed telecined and real interlaced content,\nfieldmatch will not be able to match fields for the interlaced parts.\nBut these remaining combed frames will be marked as interlaced, and thus can be\nde-interlaced by a later filter such as yadif before decimation.\n\nIn addition to the various configuration options, fieldmatch can take an\noptional second stream, activated through the ppsrc option. If\nenabled, the frames reconstruction will be based on the fields and frames from\nthis second stream. This allows the first input to be pre-processed in order to\nhelp the various algorithms of the filter, while keeping the output lossless\n(assuming the fields are matched properly). Typically, a field-aware denoiser,\nor brightness/contrast adjustments can help.\n\nNote that this filter uses the same algorithms as TIVTC/TFM (AviSynth project)\nand VIVTC/VFM (VapourSynth project). The later is a light clone of TFM from\nwhich fieldmatch is based on. While the semantic and usage are very\nclose, some behaviour and options names can differ.\n\nThe decimate filter currently only works for constant frame rate input.\nIf your input has mixed telecined (30fps) and progressive content with a lower\nframerate like 24fps use the following filterchain to produce the necessary cfr\nstream: dejudder,fps=30000/1001,fieldmatch,decimate.\n\nThe filter accepts the following options:",
