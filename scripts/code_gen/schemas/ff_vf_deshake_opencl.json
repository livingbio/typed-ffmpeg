  "description": "### 12.6 deshake_opencl\n\nFeature-point based video stabilization filter.\n\n\nThe filter accepts the following options:\n\n\n- **`tripod`**\n  - Simulates a tripod by preventing any camera movement whatsoever from the original frame. Defaults to\n0\n.\n- **`debug`**\n  - Whether or not additional debug info should be displayed, both in the processed output and in the console.\nNote that in order to see console debug output you will also need to pass\n-v verbose\nto ffmpeg.\nViewing point matches in the output video is only supported for RGB input.\nDefaults to\n0\n.\n- **`adaptive_crop`**\n  - Whether or not to do a tiny bit of cropping at the borders to cut down on the amount of mirrored pixels.\nDefaults to\n1\n.\n- **`refine_features`**\n  - Whether or not feature points should be refined at a sub-pixel level.\nThis can be turned off for a slight performance gain at the cost of precision.\nDefaults to\n1\n.\n- **`smooth_strength`**\n  - The strength of the smoothing applied to the camera path from\n0.0\nto\n1.0\n.\n1.0\nis the maximum smoothing strength while values less than that result in less smoothing.\n0.0\ncauses the filter to adaptively choose a smoothing strength on a per-frame basis.\nDefaults to\n0.0\n.\n- **`smooth_window_multiplier`**\n  - Controls the size of the smoothing window (the number of frames buffered to determine motion information from).\nThe size of the smoothing window is determined by multiplying the framerate of the video by this number.\nAcceptable values range from\n0.1\nto\n10.0\n.\nLarger values increase the amount of motion data available for determining how to smooth the camera path,\npotentially improving smoothness, but also increase latency and memory usage.\nDefaults to\n2.0\n.\nSimulates a tripod by preventing any camera movement whatsoever from the original frame.
