  "description": "### 8.106 sidechaingate\n\nA sidechain gate acts like a normal (wideband) gate but has the ability to\nfilter the detected signal before sending it to the gain reduction stage.\nNormally a gate uses the full range signal to detect a level above the\nthreshold.\nFor example: If you cut all lower frequencies from your sidechain signal\nthe gate will decrease the volume of your track only if not enough highs\nappear. With this technique you are able to reduce the resonation of a\nnatural drum or remove \"rumbling\" of muted strokes from a heavily distorted\nguitar.\nIt needs two input streams and returns one output stream.\nFirst input stream will be processed depending on second stream signal.\n\n\nThe filter accepts the following options:\n\n\n- **`level_in`**\n  - Set input level before filtering.\nDefault is 1. Allowed range is from 0.015625 to 64.\n- **`mode`**\n  - Set the mode of operation. Can be\nupward\nor\ndownward\n.\nDefault is\ndownward\n. If set to\nupward\nmode, higher parts of signal\nwill be amplified, expanding dynamic range in upward direction.\nOtherwise, in case of\ndownward\nlower parts of signal will be reduced.\n- **`range`**\n  - Set the level of gain reduction when the signal is below the threshold.\nDefault is 0.06125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.\nSetting this to 0 disables reduction and then filter behaves like expander.\n- **`threshold`**\n  - If a signal rises above this level the gain reduction is released.\nDefault is 0.125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.\n- **`ratio`**\n  - Set a ratio about which the signal is reduced.\nDefault is 2. Allowed range is from 1 to 9000.\n- **`attack`**\n  - Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain\nreduction stops.\nDefault is 20 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.\n- **`release`**\n  - Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before the\nreduction is increased again. Default is 250 milliseconds.\nAllowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.\n- **`makeup`**\n  - Set amount of amplification of signal after processing.\nDefault is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 64.\n- **`knee`**\n  - Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly.\nDefault is 2.828427125. Allowed range is from 1 to 8.\n- **`detection`**\n  - Choose if exact signal should be taken for detection or an RMS like one.\nDefault is rms. Can be peak or rms.\n- **`link`**\n  - Choose if the average level between all channels or the louder channel affects\nthe reduction.\nDefault is average. Can be average or maximum.\n- **`level_sc`**\n  - Set sidechain gain. Default is 1. Range is from 0.015625 to 64.\nSet input level before filtering.\nDefault is 1. Allowed range is from 0.015625 to 64.\n\n\nSet the mode of operation. Can be upward or downward.\nDefault is downward. If set to upward mode, higher parts of signal\nwill be amplified, expanding dynamic range in upward direction.\nOtherwise, in case of downward lower parts of signal will be reduced.\n\n\nSet the level of gain reduction when the signal is below the threshold.\nDefault is 0.06125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.\nSetting this to 0 disables reduction and then filter behaves like expander.\n\n\nIf a signal rises above this level the gain reduction is released.\nDefault is 0.125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.\n\n\nSet a ratio about which the signal is reduced.\nDefault is 2. Allowed range is from 1 to 9000.\n\n\nAmount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain\nreduction stops.\nDefault is 20 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.\n\n\nAmount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before the\nreduction is increased again. Default is 250 milliseconds.\nAllowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.\n\n\nSet amount of amplification of signal after processing.\nDefault is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 64.\n\n\nCurve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly.\nDefault is 2.828427125. Allowed range is from 1 to 8.\n\n\nChoose if exact signal should be taken for detection or an RMS like one.\nDefault is rms. Can be peak or rms.\n\n\nChoose if the average level between all channels or the louder channel affects\nthe reduction.\nDefault is average. Can be average or maximum.\n\n\nSet sidechain gain. Default is 1. Range is from 0.015625 to 64.\n\n\n",
