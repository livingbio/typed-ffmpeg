  "description": "### 18.34 zmq, azmq\n\nReceive commands sent through a libzmq client, and forward them to\nfilters in the filtergraph.\n\n\nzmq and azmq work as a pass-through filters. zmq\nmust be inserted between two video filters, azmq between two\naudio filters. Both are capable to send messages to any filter type.\n\n\nTo enable these filters you need to install the libzmq library and\nheaders and configure FFmpeg with --enable-libzmq.\n\n\nFor more information about libzmq see:\nhttp://www.zeromq.org/\n\n\nThe zmq and azmq filters work as a libzmq server, which\nreceives messages sent through a network interface defined by the\nbind_address (or the abbreviation \"b\") option.\nDefault value of this option is tcp://localhost:5555. You may\nwant to alter this value to your needs, but do not forget to escape any\n\u2019:\u2019 signs (see filtergraph escaping).\n\n\nThe received message must be in the form:\n\n\nTARGET specifies the target of the command, usually the name of\nthe filter class or a specific filter instance name. The default\nfilter instance name uses the pattern \u2018Parsed_<filter_name>_<index>\u2019,\nbut you can override this by using the \u2018filter_name@id\u2019 syntax\n(see Filtergraph syntax).\n\n\nCOMMAND specifies the name of the command for the target filter.\n\n\nARG is optional and specifies the optional argument list for the\ngiven COMMAND.\n\n\nUpon reception, the message is processed and the corresponding command\nis injected into the filtergraph. Depending on the result, the filter\nwill send a reply to the client, adopting the format:\n\n\nMESSAGE is optional.\n\n\n",
