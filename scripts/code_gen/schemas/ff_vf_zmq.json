  "description": "### 18.34 zmq, azmq\n\nReceive commands sent through a libzmq client, and forward them to filters in\nthe filtergraph.\n\n`zmq` and `azmq` work as a pass-through filters. `zmq` must be inserted\nbetween two video filters, `azmq` between two audio filters. Both are capable\nto send messages to any filter type.\n\nTo enable these filters you need to install the libzmq library and headers and\nconfigure FFmpeg with `--enable-libzmq`.\n\nFor more information about libzmq see: <http://www.zeromq.org/>\n\nThe `zmq` and `azmq` filters work as a libzmq server, which receives messages\nsent through a network interface defined by the bind_address (or the\nabbreviation \"b\") option. Default value of this option is\ntcp://localhost:5555. You may want to alter this value to your needs, but do\nnot forget to escape any \u2019:\u2019 signs (see filtergraph escaping).\n\nThe received message must be in the form:\n\n    \n    \n    TARGET COMMAND [ARG]\n    \n\nTARGET specifies the target of the command, usually the name of the filter\nclass or a specific filter instance name. The default filter instance name\nuses the pattern \u2018Parsed_<filter_name>_<index>\u2019, but you can override this by\nusing the \u2018filter_name@id\u2019 syntax (see Filtergraph syntax).\n\nCOMMAND specifies the name of the command for the target filter.\n\nARG is optional and specifies the optional argument list for the given\nCOMMAND.\n\nUpon reception, the message is processed and the corresponding command is\ninjected into the filtergraph. Depending on the result, the filter will send a\nreply to the client, adopting the format:\n\n    \n    \n    ERROR_CODE ERROR_REASON\n    MESSAGE\n    \n\nMESSAGE is optional.\n\n",
