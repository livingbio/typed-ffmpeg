Allowed range is from\n10\nto\n100\n. Default value is\n55\nmilliseconds.\nThis sets size of window which will be processed at once.\n- **`overlap, o`**\n  - Set window overlap, in percentage of window size. Allowed range is from\n50\nto\n95\n. Default value is\n75\npercent.\nSetting this to a very high value increases impulsive noise removal but makes\nwhole process much slower.\n- **`arorder, a`**\n  - Set autoregression order, in percentage of window size. Allowed range is from\n0\nto\n25\n. Default value is\n2\npercent. This option also\ncontrols quality of interpolated samples using neighbour good samples.\n- **`threshold, t`**\n  - Set threshold value. Allowed range is from\n1\nto\n100\n.\nDefault value is\n2\n.\nThis controls the strength of impulsive noise which is going to be removed.\nThe lower value, the more samples will be detected as impulsive noise.\n- **`burst, b`**\n  - Set burst fusion, in percentage of window size. Allowed range is\n0\nto\n10\n. Default value is\n2\n.\nIf any two samples detected as noise are spaced less than this value then any\nsample between those two samples will be also detected as noise.\n- **`method, m`**\n  - Set overlap method.\nIt accepts the following values:\nadd, a\nSelect overlap-add method.
