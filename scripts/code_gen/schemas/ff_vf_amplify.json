  "description": "### 11.4 amplify\n\nAmplify differences between current pixel and pixels of adjacent frames in\nsame pixel location.\n\n\nThis filter accepts the following options:\n\n\n- **`radius`**\n  - Set frame radius. Default is 2. Allowed range is from 1 to 63.\nFor example radius of 3 will instruct filter to calculate average of 7 frames.\n- **`factor`**\n  - Set factor to amplify difference. Default is 2. Allowed range is from 0 to 65535.\n- **`threshold`**\n  - Set threshold for difference amplification. Any difference greater or equal to\nthis value will not alter source pixel. Default is 10.\nAllowed range is from 0 to 65535.\n- **`tolerance`**\n  - Set tolerance for difference amplification. Any difference lower to\nthis value will not alter source pixel. Default is 0.\nAllowed range is from 0 to 65535.\n- **`low`**\n  - Set lower limit for changing source pixel. Default is 65535. Allowed range is from 0 to 65535.\nThis option controls maximum possible value that will decrease source pixel value.\n- **`high`**\n  - Set high limit for changing source pixel. Default is 65535. Allowed range is from 0 to 65535.\nThis option controls maximum possible value that will increase source pixel value.\n- **`planes`**\n  - Set which planes to filter. Default is all. Allowed range is from 0 to 15.\nSet frame radius. Default is 2.
