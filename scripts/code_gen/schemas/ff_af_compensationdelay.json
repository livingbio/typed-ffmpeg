  "description": "### 8.78 compensationdelay\n\nCompensation Delay Line is a metric based delay to compensate differing\npositions of microphones or speakers.\n\nFor example, you have recorded guitar with two microphones placed in different\nlocations. Because the front of sound wave has fixed speed in normal\nconditions, the phasing of microphones can vary and depends on their location\nand interposition. The best sound mix can be achieved when these microphones\nare in phase (synchronized). Note that a distance of ~30 cm between\nmicrophones makes one microphone capture the signal in antiphase to the other\nmicrophone. That makes the final mix sound moody. This filter helps to solve\nphasing problems by adding different delays to each microphone track and make\nthem synchronized.\n\nThe best result can be reached when you take one track as base and synchronize\nother tracks one by one with it. Remember that synchronization/delay tolerance\ndepends on sample rate, too. Higher sample rates will give more tolerance.\n\nThe filter accepts the following parameters:\n\n**mm**\n\n    Set millimeters distance. This is compensation distance for fine tuning. Default is 0. \n\n**cm**\n\n    Set cm distance. This is compensation distance for tightening distance setup. Default is 0. \n\n**m**\n\n    Set meters distance. This is compensation distance for hard distance setup. Default is 0. \n\n**dry**\n\n    Set dry amount. Amount of unprocessed (dry) signal. Default is 0. \n\n**wet**\n\n    Set wet amount. Amount of processed (wet) signal. Default is 1. \n\n**temp**\n\n    Set temperature in degrees Celsius. This is the temperature of the environment. Default is 20. \n\n",
