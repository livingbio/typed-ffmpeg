  "description": "### 11.207 removegrain\n\nThe removegrain filter is a spatial denoiser for progressive video.\n\n**m0**\n\n    Set mode for the first plane. \n\n**m1**\n\n    Set mode for the second plane. \n\n**m2**\n\n    Set mode for the third plane. \n\n**m3**\n\n    Set mode for the fourth plane. \n\nRange of mode is from 0 to 24. Description of each mode follows:\n\n**0**\n\n    Leave input plane unchanged. Default. \n\n**1**\n\n    Clips the pixel with the minimum and maximum of the 8 neighbour pixels. \n\n**2**\n\n    Clips the pixel with the second minimum and maximum of the 8 neighbour pixels. \n\n**3**\n\n    Clips the pixel with the third minimum and maximum of the 8 neighbour pixels. \n\n**4**\n\n    Clips the pixel with the fourth minimum and maximum of the 8 neighbour pixels. This is equivalent to a median filter. \n\n**5**\n\n    Line-sensitive clipping giving the minimal change. \n\n**6**\n\n    Line-sensitive clipping, intermediate. \n\n**7**\n\n    Line-sensitive clipping, intermediate. \n\n**8**\n\n    Line-sensitive clipping, intermediate. \n\n**9**\n\n    Line-sensitive clipping on a line where the neighbours pixels are the closest. \n\n**10**\n\n    Replaces the target pixel with the closest neighbour. \n\n**11**\n\n    [1 2 1] horizontal and vertical kernel blur. \n\n**12**\n\n    Same as mode 11. \n\n**13**\n\n    Bob mode, interpolates top field from the line where the neighbours pixels are the closest. \n\n**14**\n\n    Bob mode, interpolates bottom field from the line where the neighbours pixels are the closest. \n\n**15**\n\n    Bob mode, interpolates top field. Same as 13 but with a more complicated interpolation formula. \n\n**16**\n\n    Bob mode, interpolates bottom field. Same as 14 but with a more complicated interpolation formula. \n\n**17**\n\n    Clips the pixel with the minimum and maximum of respectively the maximum and minimum of each pair of opposite neighbour pixels. \n\n**18**\n\n    Line-sensitive clipping using opposite neighbours whose greatest distance from the current pixel is minimal. \n\n**19**\n\n    Replaces the pixel with the average of its 8 neighbours. \n\n**20**\n\n    Averages the 9 pixels ([1 1 1] horizontal and vertical blur). \n\n**21**\n\n    Clips pixels using the averages of opposite neighbour. \n\n**22**\n\n    Same as mode 21 but simpler and faster. \n\n**23**\n\n    Small edge and halo removal, but reputed useless. \n\n**24**\n\n    Similar as 23. \n\n",
