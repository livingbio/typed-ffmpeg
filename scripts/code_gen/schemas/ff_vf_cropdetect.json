  "description": "### 11.51 cropdetect\n\nAuto-detect the crop size.\n\n\nIt calculates the necessary cropping parameters and prints the\nrecommended parameters via the logging system. The detected dimensions\ncorrespond to the non-black or video area of the input video according to mode.\n\n\nIt accepts the following parameters:\n\n\n- **`mode`**\n  - Depending on\nmode\ncrop detection is based on either the mere black value of surrounding pixels or a combination of motion vectors and edge pixels.\n\u2018\nblack\n\u2019\nDetect black pixels surrounding the playing video. For fine control use option\nlimit\n.\n\u2018\nmvedges\n\u2019\nDetect the playing video by the motion vectors inside the video and scanning for edge pixels typically forming the border of a playing video.\n- **`limit`**\n  - Set higher black value threshold, which can be optionally specified\nfrom nothing (0) to everything (255 for 8-bit based formats). An intensity\nvalue greater to the set value is considered non-black. It defaults to 24.\nYou can also specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0 which will be scaled depending\non the bitdepth of the pixel format.\n- **`round`**\n  - The value which the width/height should be divisible by. It defaults to\n16. The offset is automatically adjusted to center the video. Use 2 to\nget only even dimensions (needed for 4:2:2 video). 16 is best when\nencoding to most video codecs.\n- **`skip`**\n  - Set the number of initial frames for which evaluation is skipped.\nDefault is 2. Range is 0 to INT_MAX.\n- **`reset_count, reset`**\n  - Set the counter that determines after how many frames cropdetect will\nreset the previously detected largest video area and start over to\ndetect the current optimal crop area. Default value is 0.\nThis can be useful when channel logos distort the video area. 0\nindicates \u2019never reset\u2019, and returns the largest area encountered during\nplayback.\n- **`mv_threshold`**\n  - Set motion in pixel units as threshold for motion detection. It defaults to 8.\n- **`low`**\n- **`high`**\n  - Set low and high threshold values used by the Canny thresholding\nalgorithm.\nThe high threshold selects the \"strong\" edge pixels, which are then\nconnected through 8-connectivity with the \"weak\" edge pixels selected\nby the low threshold.\nlow\nand\nhigh\nthreshold values must be chosen in the range\n[0,1], and\nlow\nshould be lesser or equal to\nhigh\n.\nDefault value for\nlow\nis\n5/255\n, and default value for\nhigh\nis\n15/255\n.\nDepending on mode crop detection is based on either the mere black value of surrounding pixels or a combination of motion vectors and edge pixels.\n\n\n- **`\u2018black\u2019`**\n  - Detect black pixels surrounding the playing video.
