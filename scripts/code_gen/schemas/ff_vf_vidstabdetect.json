  "description": "### 11.274 vidstabdetect\n\nAnalyze video stabilization/deshaking. Perform pass 1 of 2, see\nvidstabtransform for pass 2.\n\n\nThis filter generates a file with relative translation and rotation\ntransform information about subsequent frames, which is then used by\nthe vidstabtransform filter.\n\n\nTo enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with\n--enable-libvidstab.\n\n\nThis filter accepts the following options:\n\n\n- **`result`**\n  - Set the path to the file used to write the transforms information.\nDefault value is\ntransforms.trf\n.\n- **`shakiness`**\n  - Set how shaky the video is and how quick the camera is. It accepts an\ninteger in the range 1-10, a value of 1 means little shakiness, a\nvalue of 10 means strong shakiness. Default value is 5.\n- **`accuracy`**\n  - Set the accuracy of the detection process. It must be a value in the\nrange 1-15. A value of 1 means low accuracy, a value of 15 means high\naccuracy. Default value is 15.\n- **`stepsize`**\n  - Set stepsize of the search process. The region around minimum is\nscanned with 1 pixel resolution. Default value is 6.\n- **`mincontrast`**\n  - Set minimum contrast. Below this value a local measurement field is\ndiscarded. Must be a floating point value in the range 0-1. Default\nvalue is 0.3.\n- **`tripod`**\n  - Set reference frame number for tripod mode.\nIf enabled, the motion of the frames is compared to a reference frame\nin the filtered stream, identified by the specified number. The idea\nis to compensate all movements in a more-or-less static scene and keep\nthe camera view absolutely still.\nIf set to 0, it is disabled. The frames are counted starting from 1.\n- **`show`**\n  - Show fields and transforms in the resulting frames. It accepts an\ninteger in the range 0-2. Default value is 0, which disables any\nvisualization.\n- **`fileformat`**\n  - Format for the transforms data file to be written.\nAcceptable values are\n\u2018\nascii\n\u2019\nHuman-readable plain text\n\u2018\nbinary\n\u2019\nBinary format, roughly 40% smaller than\nascii\n. (\ndefault\n)\nSet the path to the file used to write the transforms information.\nDefault value is transforms.trf.\n\n\nSet how shaky the video is and how quick the camera is.
