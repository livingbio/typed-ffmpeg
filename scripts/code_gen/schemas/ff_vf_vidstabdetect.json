  "description": "### 11.274 vidstabdetect\n\nAnalyze video stabilization/deshaking. Perform pass 1 of 2, see\nvidstabtransform for pass 2.\n\nThis filter generates a file with relative translation and rotation transform\ninformation about subsequent frames, which is then used by the\nvidstabtransform filter.\n\nTo enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with\n`--enable-libvidstab`.\n\nThis filter accepts the following options:\n\n**result**\n\n    Set the path to the file used to write the transforms information. Default value is transforms.trf. \n\n**shakiness**\n\n    Set how shaky the video is and how quick the camera is. It accepts an integer in the range 1-10, a value of 1 means little shakiness, a value of 10 means strong shakiness. Default value is 5. \n\n**accuracy**\n\n    Set the accuracy of the detection process. It must be a value in the range 1-15. A value of 1 means low accuracy, a value of 15 means high accuracy. Default value is 15. \n\n**stepsize**\n\n    Set stepsize of the search process. The region around minimum is scanned with 1 pixel resolution. Default value is 6. \n\n**mincontrast**\n\n    Set minimum contrast. Below this value a local measurement field is discarded. Must be a floating point value in the range 0-1. Default value is 0.3. \n\n**tripod**\n\n    Set reference frame number for tripod mode. If enabled, the motion of the frames is compared to a reference frame in the filtered stream, identified by the specified number. The idea is to compensate all movements in a more-or-less static scene and keep the camera view absolutely still. If set to 0, it is disabled. The frames are counted starting from 1. \n\n**show**\n\n    Show fields and transforms in the resulting frames. It accepts an integer in the range 0-2. Default value is 0, which disables any visualization. \n\n**fileformat**\n\n    Format for the transforms data file to be written. Acceptable values are \u2018ascii\u2019 Human-readable plain text \u2018binary\u2019 Binary format, roughly 40% smaller than ascii. (default) \n\n",
