<p>Make audio easier to listen to on headphones.
</p>
<p>This filter adds &lsquo;cues&rsquo; to 44.1kHz stereo (i.e. audio CD format) audio
so that when listened to on headphones the stereo image is moved from
inside your head (standard for headphones) to outside and in front of
the listener (standard for speakers).
