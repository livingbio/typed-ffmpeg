  <p>Apply Temporal Midway Video Equalization effect.

  </p>

  <p>Midway Video Equalization adjusts a sequence of video frames to have the same

  histograms, while maintaining their dynamics as much as possible. It&rsquo;s

  useful for e.g. matching exposures from a video frames sequence.

  </p>

  <p>This filter accepts the following option:

  </p>

  <dl compact="compact">

  <dt><samp>radius</samp></dt>

  <dd><p>Set filtering radius. Default is <code>5</code>. Allowed range is from 1
  to 127.

  </p>

  </dd>

  <dt><samp>sigma</samp></dt>

  <dd><p>Set filtering sigma. Default is <code>0.5</code>. This controls strength
  of filtering.

  Setting this option to 0 effectively does nothing.

  </p>

  </dd>

  <dt><samp>planes</samp></dt>

  <dd><p>Set which planes to process. Default is <code>15</code>, which is all available
  planes.
