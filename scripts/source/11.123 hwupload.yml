description: '11.123 hwupload

  Upload system memory frames to hardware surfaces.


  The device to upload to must be supplied when the filter is initialised.  If

  using ffmpeg, select the appropriate device with the -filter_hw_device

  option or with the derive_device option.  The input and output devices

  must be of different types and compatible - the exact meaning of this is

  system-dependent, but typically it means that they must refer to the same

  underlying hardware context (for example, refer to the same graphics card).


  The following additional parameters are accepted:'
