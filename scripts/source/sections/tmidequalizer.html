<p>Apply Temporal Midway Video Equalization effect.
</p>
<p>Midway Video Equalization adjusts a sequence of video frames to have the same
histograms, while maintaining their dynamics as much as possible. It&rsquo;s
useful for e.g. matching exposures from a video frames sequence.

<p>This filter accepts the following option:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>radius</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set filtering radius. Default is <code>5</code>. Allowed range is from 1 to 127.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>sigma</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set filtering sigma. Default is <code>0.5</code>. This controls strength of filtering.
Setting this option to 0 effectively does nothing.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>planes</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set which planes to process. Default is <code>15</code>, which is all available planes.
</p></dd>
