<p>Remove silence from the beginning, middle or end of the audio.
</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>start_periods</samp></dt>
<dd><p>This value is used to indicate if audio should be trimmed at beginning of
the audio. A value of zero indicates no silence should be trimmed from the
beginning. When specifying a non-zero value, it trims audio up until it
finds non-silence. Normally, when trimming silence from beginning of audio
the <var>start_periods</var> will be <code>1</code> but it can be increased to higher
values to trim all audio up to specific count of non-silence periods.
Default value is <code>0</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>start_duration</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Specify the amount of time that non-silence must be detected before it stops
trimming audio. By increasing the duration, bursts of noises can be treated
as silence and trimmed off. Default value is <code>0</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>start_threshold</samp></dt>
<dd><p>This indicates what sample value should be treated as silence. For digital
audio, a value of <code>0</code> may be fine but for audio recorded from analog,
you may wish to increase the value to account for background noise.
Can be specified in dB (in case &quot;dB&quot; is appended to the specified value)
or amplitude ratio. Default value is <code>0</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>start_silence</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Specify max duration of silence at beginning that will be kept after
trimming. Default is 0, which is equal to trimming all samples detected
as silence.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>start_mode</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Specify mode of detection of silence end at start of multi-channel audio.
Can be <var>any</var> or <var>all</var>. Default is <var>any</var>.
With <var>any</var>, any sample from any channel that is detected as non-silence
will trigger end of silence trimming at start of audio stream.
With <var>all</var>, only if every sample from every channel is detected as non-silence
will trigger end of silence trimming at start of audio stream, limited usage.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>stop_periods</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set the count for trimming silence from the end of audio. When specifying a
positive value, it trims audio after it finds specified silence period.
To remove silence from the middle of a file, specify a <var>stop_periods</var>
that is negative. This value is then treated as a positive value and is
used to indicate the effect should restart processing as specified by
<var>stop_periods</var>, making it suitable for removing periods of silence
in the middle of the audio.
Default value is <code>0</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>stop_duration</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Specify a duration of silence that must exist before audio is not copied any
more. By specifying a higher duration, silence that is wanted can be left in
the audio.
Default value is <code>0</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>stop_threshold</samp></dt>
<dd><p>This is the same as <samp>start_threshold</samp> but for trimming silence from
the end of audio.
Can be specified in dB (in case &quot;dB&quot; is appended to the specified value)
or amplitude ratio. Default value is <code>0</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>stop_silence</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Specify max duration of silence at end that will be kept after
trimming. Default is 0, which is equal to trimming all samples detected
as silence.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>stop_mode</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Specify mode of detection of silence start after start of multi-channel audio.
Can be <var>any</var> or <var>all</var>. Default is <var>all</var>.
With <var>any</var>, any sample from any channel that is detected as silence
will trigger start of silence trimming after start of audio stream, limited usage.
With <var>all</var>, only if every sample from every channel is detected as silence
will trigger start of silence trimming after start of audio stream.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>detection</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set how is silence detected.
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>avg</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Mean of absolute values of samples in moving window.
</p></dd>
<dt><samp>rms</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Root squared mean of absolute values of samples in moving window.
</p></dd>
<dt><samp>peak</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Maximum of absolute values of samples in moving window.
</p></dd>
<dt><samp>median</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Median of absolute values of samples in moving window.
</p></dd>
<dt><samp>ptp</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Absolute of max peak to min peak difference of samples in moving window.
</p></dd>
<dt><samp>dev</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Standard deviation of values of samples in moving window.
</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>Default value is <code>rms</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>window</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set duration in number of seconds used to calculate size of window in number
of samples for detecting silence. Using <code>0</code> will effectively disable
any windowing and use only single sample per channel for silence detection.
In that case it may be needed to also set <samp>start_silence</samp> and/or
<samp>stop_silence</samp> to nonzero values with also <samp>start_duration</samp> and/or
<samp>stop_duration</samp> to nonzero values.
Default value is <code>0.02</code>. Allowed range is from <code>0</code> to <code>10</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>timestamp</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set processing mode of every audio frame output timestamp.
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>write</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Full timestamps rewrite, keep only the start time for the first output frame.
</p></dd>
<dt><samp>copy</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Non-dropped frames are left with same timestamp as input audio frame.
</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>Defaults value is <code>write</code>.
