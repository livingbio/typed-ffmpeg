<p>Audio pulsator is something between an autopanner and a tremolo.
But it can produce funny stereo effects as well. Pulsator changes the volume
of the left and right channel based on a LFO (low frequency oscillator) with
different waveforms and shifted phases.
This filter have the ability to define an offset between left and right
channel. An offset of 0 means that both LFO shapes match each other.
The left and right channel are altered equally - a conventional tremolo.
An offset of 50% means that the shape of the right channel is exactly shifted
in phase (or moved backwards about half of the frequency) - pulsator acts as
an autopanner. At 1 both curves match again. Every setting in between moves the
phase shift gapless between all stages and produces some &quot;bypassing&quot; sounds with
sine and triangle waveforms. The more you set the offset near 1 (starting from
the 0.5) the faster the signal passes from the left to the right speaker.

<p>The filter accepts the following options:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>level_in</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set input gain. By default it is 1. Range is [0.015625 - 64].
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>level_out</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set output gain. By default it is 1. Range is [0.015625 - 64].
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>mode</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set waveform shape the LFO will use. Can be one of: sine, triangle, square,
sawup or sawdown. Default is sine.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>amount</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set modulation. Define how much of original signal is affected by the LFO.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>offset_l</samp></dt>
