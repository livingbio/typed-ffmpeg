description: '11.201 pullup

  Pulldown reversal (inverse telecine) filter, capable of handling mixed

  hard-telecine, 24000/1001 fps progressive, and 30000/1001 fps progressive

  content.


  The pullup filter is designed to take advantage of future context in making

  its decisions. This filter is stateless in the sense that it does not lock

  onto a pattern to follow, but it instead looks forward to the following

  fields in order to identify matches and rebuild progressive frames.


  To produce content with an even framerate, insert the fps filter after

  pullup, use fps=24000/1001 if the input frame rate is 29.97fps,

  fps=24 for 30fps and the (rare) telecined 25fps input.


  The filter accepts the following options:



  For best results (without duplicated frames in the output file) it is

  necessary to change the output frame rate. For example, to inverse

  telecine NTSC input:


  ffmpeg -i input -vf pullup -r 24000/1001 ...'
