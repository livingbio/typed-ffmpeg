description: '8.80 crystalizer

  Simple algorithm for audio noise sharpening.


  This filter linearly increases differences between each audio sample.


  The filter accepts the following options:'
name: crystalizer
parameters:
- description: '<dd><p>Sets the intensity of effect (default: 2.0). Must be in range
    between -10.0 to 0

    (unchanged sound) to 10.0 (maximum effect).

    To inverse filtering use negative value.

    </p>
