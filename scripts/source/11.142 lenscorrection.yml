  Correct radial lens distortion


  This filter can be used to correct for radial distortion as can result from the
  use

  of wide angle lenses, and thereby re-rectify the image. To find the right parameters

  one can use tools available for example as part of opencv or simply trial-and-error.

  To use opencv use the calibration sample (under samples/cpp) from the opencv sources

  and extract the k1 and k2 coefficients from the resulting matrix.


  Note that effectively the same filter is available in the open-source tools Krita
  and

  Digikam from the KDE project.


  In contrast to the vignette filter, which can also be used to compensate lens errors,

  this filter corrects the distortion of the image, whereas vignette corrects the

  brightness distribution, so you may want to use both filters together in certain

  cases, though you will have to take care of ordering, i.e. whether vignetting should

  be applied before or after lens correction.'
