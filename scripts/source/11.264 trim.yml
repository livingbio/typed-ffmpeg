  <p>Trim the input so that the output contains one continuous subpart of the input.

  </p>

  <p>It accepts the following parameters:

  </p><dl compact="compact">

  <dt><samp>start</samp></dt>

  <dd><p>Specify the time of the start of the kept section, i.e. the frame with the

  timestamp <var>start</var> will be the first frame in the output.

  </p>

  </dd>

  <dt><samp>end</samp></dt>

  <dd><p>Specify the time of the first frame that will be dropped, i.e. the frame

  immediately preceding the one with the timestamp <var>end</var> will be the last

  frame in the output.

  </p>

  </dd>

  <dt><samp>start_pts</samp></dt>

  <dd><p>This is the same as <var>start</var>, except this option sets the start timestamp

  in timebase units instead of seconds.

  </p>

  </dd>

  <dt><samp>end_pts</samp></dt>

  <dd><p>This is the same as <var>end</var>, except this option sets the end timestamp

  in timebase units instead of seconds.

  </p>

  </dd>

  <dt><samp>duration</samp></dt>

  <dd><p>The maximum duration of the output in seconds.

  </p>

  </dd>

  <dt><samp>start_frame</samp></dt>

  <dd><p>The number of the first frame that should be passed to the output.

  </p>

  </dd>

  <dt><samp>end_frame</samp></dt>

  <dd><p>The number of the first frame that should be dropped.

  </p></dd>

  </dl>


  <p><samp>start</samp>, <samp>end</samp>, and <samp>duration</samp> are expressed
  as time

  duration specifications; see

  <a href="ffmpeg-utils.html#time-duration-syntax">(ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration
  section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual</a>

  for the accepted syntax.

  </p>

  <p>Note that the first two sets of the start/end options and the <samp>duration</samp>

  option look at the frame timestamp, while the _frame variants simply count the

  frames that pass through the filter. Also note that this filter does not modify

  the timestamps. If you wish for the output timestamps to start at zero, insert a

  setpts filter after the trim filter.

  </p>

  <p>If multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries to be greedy and

  keep all the frames that match at least one of the specified constraints. To keep

  only the part that matches all the constraints at once, chain multiple trim

  filters.

  </p>

  <p>The defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is possible to set e.g.

  just the end values to keep everything before the specified time.

  </p>

  <p>Examples:

  </p><ul>

  <li> Drop everything except the second minute of input:

  <div class="example">

  <pre class="example">ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf trim=60:120

  </pre></div>


  </li><li> Keep only the first second:

  <div class="example">

  <pre class="example">ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf trim=duration=1

  </pre></div>


  </li></ul>
