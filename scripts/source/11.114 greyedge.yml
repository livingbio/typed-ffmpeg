  A color constancy variation filter which estimates scene illumination via grey edge
  algorithm

  and corrects the scene colors accordingly.

  The filter accepts the following options:'
name: greyedge
parameters:
- description: '<dd><p>The order of differentiation to be applied on the scene. Must
    be chosen in the range

    [0,2] and default value is 1.
