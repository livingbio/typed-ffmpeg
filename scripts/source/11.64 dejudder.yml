  Remove judder produced by partially interlaced telecined content.


  Judder can be introduced, for instance, by pullup filter. If the original

  source was partially telecined content then the output of pullup,dejudder

  will have a variable frame rate. May change the recorded frame rate of the

  container. Aside from that change, this filter will not affect constant frame

  rate video.


  The option available in this filter is:'
