<p>Denoise frames using Non-Local Means algorithm.
</p>
<p>Each pixel is adjusted by looking for other pixels with similar contexts. This
context similarity is defined by comparing their surrounding patches of size
<samp>p</samp>x<samp>p</samp>. Patches are searched in an area of <samp>r</samp>x<samp>r</samp>
around the pixel.
</p>
<p>Note that the research area defines centers for patches, which means some
patches will be made of pixels outside that research area.
</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options.
