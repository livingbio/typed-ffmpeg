  <p>Buffer video frames, and make them available to the end of the filter

  graph.

  </p>

  <p>This sink is mainly intended for programmatic use, in particular

  through the interface defined in <samp>libavfilter/buffersink.h</samp>

  or the options system.

  </p>

  <p>It accepts a pointer to an AVBufferSinkContext structure, which

  defines the incoming buffers&rsquo; formats, to be passed as the opaque

  parameter to <code>avfilter_init_filter</code> for initialization.
