  <p>Mix channels with specific gain levels. The filter accepts the output

  channel layout followed by a set of channels definitions.

  </p>

  <p>This filter is also designed to efficiently remap the channels of an audio

  stream.

  </p>

  <p>The filter accepts parameters of the form:

  &quot;<var>l</var>|<var>outdef</var>|<var>outdef</var>|...&quot;

  </p>

  <dl compact="compact">

  <dt><samp>l</samp></dt>

  <dd><p>output channel layout or number of channels

  </p>

  </dd>

  <dt><samp>outdef</samp></dt>

  <dd><p>output channel specification, of the form:

  &quot;<var>out_name</var>=[<var>gain</var>*]<var>in_name</var>[(+-)[<var>gain</var>*]<var>in_name</var>...]&quot;

  </p>

  <p>If the &lsquo;=&rsquo; in a channel specification is replaced by &lsquo;&lt;&rsquo;,
  then the gains for

  that specification will be renormalized so that the total is 1, thus

  avoiding clipping noise.
