description: '8.65 atempo

  Adjust audio tempo.


  The filter accepts exactly one parameter, the audio tempo. If not

  specified then the filter will assume nominal 1.0 tempo. Tempo must

  be in the [0.5, 100.0] range.


  Note that tempo greater than 2 will skip some samples rather than

  blend them in.  If for any reason this is a concern it is always

  possible to daisy-chain several instances of atempo to achieve the

  desired product tempo.'
