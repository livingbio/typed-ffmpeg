  <p>Make audio easier to listen to on headphones.

  </p>

  <p>This filter adds &lsquo;cues&rsquo; to 44.1kHz stereo (i.e. audio CD format)
  audio

  so that when listened to on headphones the stereo image is moved from

  inside your head (standard for headphones) to outside and in front of

  the listener (standard for speakers).

  </p>

  <p>Ported from SoX.
