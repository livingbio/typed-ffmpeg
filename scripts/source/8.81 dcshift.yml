  Apply a DC shift to the audio.


  This can be useful to remove a DC offset (caused perhaps by a hardware problem

  in the recording chain) from the audio. The effect of a DC offset is reduced

  headroom and hence volume. The astats filter can be used to determine if

  a signal has a DC offset.'
