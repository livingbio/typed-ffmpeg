  This filter applies a global color histogram equalization on a

  per-frame basis.


  It can be used to correct video that has a compressed range of pixel

  intensities.  The filter redistributes the pixel intensities to

  equalize their distribution across the intensity range. It may be

  viewed as an "automatically adjusting contrast filter". This filter is

  useful only for correcting degraded or poorly captured source

  video.


  The filter accepts the following options:'

parameters:
- description: '<dd><p>Determine the amount of equalization to be applied.  As the
    strength

    is reduced, the distribution of pixel intensities more-and-more

    approaches that of the input frame. The value must be a float number

    in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.200.

    the intensity can be limited if needed to avoid washing-out. The value

    must be a float number in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.210.
