description: '18.15 realtime, arealtime

  Slow down filtering to match real time approximately.


  These filters will pause the filtering for a variable amount of time to

  match the output rate with the input timestamps.

  They are similar to the re option to ffmpeg.


  They accept the following options:'
name: realtime
parameters:
- description: '<dd><p>Time limit for the pauses. Any pause longer than that will
    be considered

    a timestamp discontinuity and reset the timer. Default is 2 seconds.

    </p></dd>'
  name: limit
- description: '<dd><p>Speed factor for processing. The value must be a float larger
    than zero.

    Values larger than 1.0 will result in faster than realtime processing,

    smaller will slow processing down. The <var>limit</var> is automatically adapted

    accordingly. Default is 1.0.

    </p>

    <p>A processing speed faster than what is possible without these filters cannot

    be achieved.
