description: '16.2 cellauto

  Create a pattern generated by an elementary cellular automaton.


  The initial state of the cellular automaton can be defined through the

  filename and pattern options. If such options are

  not specified an initial state is created randomly.


  At each new frame a new row in the video is filled with the result of

  the cellular automaton next generation. The behavior when the whole

  frame is filled is defined by the scroll option.


  This source accepts the following options:'
