description: '8.76 chorus

  Add a chorus effect to the audio.


  Can make a single vocal sound like a chorus, but can also be applied to instrumentation.


  Chorus resembles an echo effect with a short delay, but whereas with echo the delay
  is

  constant, with chorus, it is varied using using sinusoidal or triangular modulation.

  The modulation depth defines the range the modulated delay is played before or after

  the delay. Hence the delayed sound will sound slower or faster, that is the delayed

  sound tuned around the original one, like in a chorus where some vocals are slightly

  off key.


  It accepts the following parameters:'

parameters:
- description: '<dd><p>Set input gain. Default is 0.4.

- description: '<dd><p>Set output gain. Default is 0.4.
