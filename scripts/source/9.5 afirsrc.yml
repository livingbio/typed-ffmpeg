description: '9.5 afirsrc

  Generate a FIR coefficients using frequency sampling method.


  The resulting stream can be used with afir filter for filtering the audio signal.


  The filter accepts the following options:'
name: afirsrc
parameters:
- description: '<dd><p>Set number of filter coefficients in output audio stream.

    Default value is 1025.

    </p>

    </dd>'
  name: taps, t
- description: '<dd><p>Set frequency points from where magnitude and phase are set.

    This must be in non decreasing order, and first element must be 0, while last
    element

    must be 1. Elements are separated by white spaces.
