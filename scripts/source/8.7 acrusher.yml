  <p>Reduce audio bit resolution.

  </p>

  <p>This filter is bit crusher with enhanced functionality. A bit crusher

  is used to audibly reduce number of bits an audio signal is sampled

  with. This doesn&rsquo;t change the bit depth at all, it just produces the

  effect. Material reduced in bit depth sounds more harsh and &quot;digital&quot;.

  This filter is able to even round to continuous values instead of discrete

  bit depths.

  Additionally it has a D/C offset which results in different crushing of

  the lower and the upper half of the signal.

  An Anti-Aliasing setting is able to produce &quot;softer&quot; crushing sounds.

  </p>

  <p>Another feature of this filter is the logarithmic mode.

  This setting switches from linear distances between bits to logarithmic ones.

  The result is a much more &quot;natural&quot; sounding crusher which doesn&rsquo;t
  gate low

  signals for example. The human ear has a logarithmic perception,

  so this kind of crushing is much more pleasant.

  Logarithmic crushing is also able to get anti-aliased.
