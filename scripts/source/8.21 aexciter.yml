description: '8.21 aexciter

  An exciter is used to produce high sound that is not present in the

  original signal. This is done by creating harmonic distortions of the

  signal which are restricted in range and added to the original signal.

  An Exciter raises the upper end of an audio signal without simply raising

  the higher frequencies like an equalizer would do to create a more

  "crisp" or "brilliant" sound.


  The filter accepts the following options:'
