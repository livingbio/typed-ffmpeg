  Remove blocking artifacts from input video.


  The filter accepts the following options:'
name: deblock
parameters:
- description: '<dd><p>Set filter type, can be <var>weak</var> or <var>strong</var>.
    Default is <var>strong</var>.

    This controls what kind of deblocking is applied.

- description: '<dd><p>Set blocking detection thresholds. Allowed range is 0 to 1.

    Defaults are: <var>0.098</var> for <var>alpha</var> and <var>0.05</var> for the
    rest.

    Using higher threshold gives more deblocking strength.

    Setting <var>alpha</var> controls threshold detection at exact edge of block.

    Remaining options controls threshold detection near the edge. Each one for

    below/above or left/right. Setting any of those to <var>0</var> disables

    deblocking.
