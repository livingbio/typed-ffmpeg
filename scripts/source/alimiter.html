<p>The limiter prevents an input signal from rising over a desired threshold.
This limiter uses lookahead technology to prevent your signal from distorting.
It means that there is a small delay after the signal is processed. Keep in mind
that the delay it produces is the attack time you set.
</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>level_in</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set input gain. Default is 1.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>level_out</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set output gain. Default is 1.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>limit</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Don&rsquo;t let signals above this level pass the limiter. Default is 1.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>attack</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The limiter will reach its attenuation level in this amount of time in
milliseconds. Default is 5 milliseconds.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>release</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Come back from limiting to attenuation 1.0 in this amount of milliseconds.
Default is 50 milliseconds.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>asc</samp></dt>
<dd><p>When gain reduction is always needed ASC takes care of releasing to an
average reduction level rather than reaching a reduction of 0 in the release
time.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>asc_level</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Select how much the release time is affected by ASC, 0 means nearly no changes
in release time while 1 produces higher release times.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>level</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Auto level output signal. Default is enabled.
This normalizes audio back to 0dB if enabled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>latency</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Compensate the delay introduced by using the lookahead buffer set with attack
parameter. Also flush the valid audio data in the lookahead buffer when the
stream hits EOF.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Depending on picked setting it is recommended to upsample input 2x or 4x times
with <a href="#aresample">aresample</a> before applying this filter.
