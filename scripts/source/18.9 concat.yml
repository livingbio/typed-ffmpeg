description: '18.9 concat

  Concatenate audio and video streams, joining them together one after the

  other.


  The filter works on segments of synchronized video and audio streams. All

  segments must have the same number of streams of each type, and that will

  also be the number of streams at output.


  The filter accepts the following options:



  The filter has v+a outputs: first v video outputs, then

  a audio outputs.


  There are nx(v+a) inputs: first the inputs for the first

  segment, in the same order as the outputs, then the inputs for the second

  segment, etc.


  Related streams do not always have exactly the same duration, for various

  reasons including codec frame size or sloppy authoring. For that reason,

  related synchronized streams (e.g. a video and its audio track) should be

  concatenated at once. The concat filter will use the duration of the longest

  stream in each segment (except the last one), and if necessary pad shorter

  audio streams with silence.


  For this filter to work correctly, all segments must start at timestamp 0.


  All corresponding streams must have the same parameters in all segments; the

  filtering system will automatically select a common pixel format for video

  streams, and a common sample format, sample rate and channel layout for

  audio streams, but other settings, such as resolution, must be converted

  explicitly by the user.


  Different frame rates are acceptable but will result in variable frame rate

  at output; be sure to configure the output file to handle it.'
