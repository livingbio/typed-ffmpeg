  The setdar filter sets the Display Aspect Ratio for the filter

  output video.


  This is done by changing the specified Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect

  Ratio, according to the following equation:


  DAR = HORIZONTAL_RESOLUTION / VERTICAL_RESOLUTION * SAR


  Keep in mind that the setdar filter does not modify the pixel

  dimensions of the video frame. Also, the display aspect ratio set by

  this filter may be changed by later filters in the filterchain,

  e.g. in case of scaling or if another "setdar" or a "setsar" filter is

  applied.


  The setsar filter sets the Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect Ratio for

  the filter output video.


  Note that as a consequence of the application of this filter, the

  output display aspect ratio will change according to the equation

  above.


  Keep in mind that the sample aspect ratio set by the setsar

  filter may be changed by later filters in the filterchain, e.g. if

  another "setsar" or a "setdar" filter is applied.


  It accepts the following parameters:



  The parameter sar is an expression containing the following constants:'
