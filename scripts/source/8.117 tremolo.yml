description: '8.117 tremolo

  Sinusoidal amplitude modulation.


  The filter accepts the following options:'
name: tremolo
parameters:
- description: '<dd><p>Modulation frequency in Hertz. Modulation frequencies in the
    subharmonic range

    (20 Hz or lower) will result in a tremolo effect.

    This filter may also be used as a ring modulator by specifying

    a modulation frequency higher than 20 Hz.

    Range is 0.1 - 20000.0. Default value is 5.0 Hz.

    </p>

  name: f
- description: '<dd><p>Depth of modulation as a percentage. Range is 0.0 - 1.0.

    Default value is 0.5.
