<p>Apply a DC shift to the audio.
</p>
<p>This can be useful to remove a DC offset (caused perhaps by a hardware problem
in the recording chain) from the audio. The effect of a DC offset is reduced
headroom and hence volume. The <a href="#astats">astats</a> filter can be used to determine if
a signal has a DC offset.
