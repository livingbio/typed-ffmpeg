  <p>Buffer audio frames, and make them available to the end of filter chain.

  </p>

  <p>This sink is mainly intended for programmatic use, in particular

  through the interface defined in <samp>libavfilter/buffersink.h</samp>

  or the options system.

  </p>

  <p>It accepts a pointer to an AVABufferSinkContext structure, which

  defines the incoming buffers&rsquo; formats, to be passed as the opaque

  parameter to <code>avfilter_init_filter</code> for initialization.

  </p>'
