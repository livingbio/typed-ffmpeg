description: '8.97 loudnorm

  EBU R128 loudness normalization. Includes both dynamic and linear normalization
  modes.

  Support for both single pass (livestreams, files) and double pass (files) modes.

  This algorithm can target IL, LRA, and maximum true peak. In dynamic mode, to accurately

  detect true peaks, the audio stream will be upsampled to 192 kHz.

  Use the -ar option or aresample filter to explicitly set an output sample rate.


  The filter accepts the following options:'
