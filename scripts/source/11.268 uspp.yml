  Apply ultra slow/simple postprocessing filter that compresses and decompresses

  the image at several (or - in the case of quality level 8 - all)

  shifts and average the results.


  The way this differs from the behavior of spp is that uspp actually encodes &

  decodes each case with libavcodec Snow, whereas spp uses a simplified intra only
  8x8

  DCT similar to MJPEG.


  This filter is only available in ffmpeg version 4.4 or earlier.


  The filter accepts the following options:'
name: uspp
parameters:
- description: '<dd><p>Set quality. This option defines the number of levels for averaging.
    It accepts

    an integer in the range 0-8. If set to <code>0</code>, the filter will have no

    effect. A value of <code>8</code> means the higher quality. For each increment
    of

    that value the speed drops by a factor of approximately 2.  Default value is

    <code>3</code>.

    </p>

    </dd>'
  name: quality
- description: '<dd><p>Force a constant quantization parameter. If not set, the filter
    will use the QP

    from the video stream (if available).

    </p>

    </dd>'
  name: qp
- description: '<dd><p>Use specified codec instead of snow.
