description: '11.294 zscale

  Scale (resize) the input video, using the z.lib library:

  https://github.com/sekrit-twc/zimg. To enable compilation of this

  filter, you need to configure FFmpeg with --enable-libzimg.


  The zscale filter forces the output display aspect ratio to be the same

  as the input, by changing the output sample aspect ratio.


  If the input image format is different from the format requested by

  the next filter, the zscale filter will convert the input to the

  requested format.'
