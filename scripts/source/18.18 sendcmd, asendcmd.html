<p>Send commands to filters in the filtergraph.
</p>
<p>These filters read commands to be sent to other filters in the
filtergraph.
</p>
<p><code>sendcmd</code> must be inserted between two video filters,
<code>asendcmd</code> must be inserted between two audio filters, but apart
from that they act the same way.
</p>
<p>The specification of commands can be provided in the filter arguments
with the <var>commands</var> option, or in a file specified by the
<var>filename</var> option.
</p>
<p>These filters accept the following options:
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>commands, c</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set the commands to be read and sent to the other filters.
</p></dd>
<dt><samp>filename, f</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set the filename of the commands to be read and sent to the other
filters.
</p></dd>
</dl>
