description: '8.105 sidechaincompress

  This filter acts like normal compressor but has the ability to compress

  detected signal using second input signal.

  It needs two input streams and returns one output stream.

  First input stream will be processed depending on second stream signal.

  The filtered signal then can be filtered with other filters in later stages of

  processing. See pan and amerge filter.


  The filter accepts the following options:'
