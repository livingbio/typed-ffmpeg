  "description": "8.106 sidechaingate\nA sidechain gate acts like a normal (wideband) gate but has the ability to\nfilter the detected signal before sending it to the gain reduction stage.\nNormally a gate uses the full range signal to detect a level above the\nthreshold.\nFor example: If you cut all lower frequencies from your sidechain signal\nthe gate will decrease the volume of your track only if not enough highs\nappear. With this technique you are able to reduce the resonation of a\nnatural drum or remove \"rumbling\" of muted strokes from a heavily distorted\nguitar.\nIt needs two input streams and returns one output stream.\nFirst input stream will be processed depending on second stream signal.\n\nThe filter accepts the following options:",
