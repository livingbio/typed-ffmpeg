  "description": "8.29 agate\nA gate is mainly used to reduce lower parts of a signal. This kind of signal\nprocessing reduces disturbing noise between useful signals.\n\nGating is done by detecting the volume below a chosen level threshold\nand dividing it by the factor set with ratio. The bottom of the noise\nfloor is set via range. Because an exact manipulation of the signal\nwould cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be levelled over\ntime. This is done by setting attack and release.\n\nattack determines how long the signal has to fall below the threshold\nbefore any reduction will occur and release sets the time the signal\nhas to rise above the threshold to reduce the reduction again.\nShorter signals than the chosen attack time will be left untouched.",
