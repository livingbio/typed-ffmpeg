The filter will load the lensfun database and\nquery it to find the corresponding camera and lens entries in the database. As\nlong as these entries can be found with the given options, the filter can\nperform corrections on frames. Note that incomplete strings will result in the\nfilter choosing the best match with the given options, and the filter will\noutput the chosen camera and lens models (logged with level \"info\"). You must\nprovide the make, camera model, and lens model as they are required.\n\nTo obtain a list of available makes and models, leave out one or both of make and\nmodel options. The filter will send the full list to the log with level INFO.\nThe first column is the make and the second column is the model.\nTo obtain a list of available lenses, set any values for make and model and leave out the\nlens_model option.
