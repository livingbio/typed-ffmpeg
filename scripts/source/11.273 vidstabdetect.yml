  Analyze video stabilization/deshaking. Perform pass 1 of 2, see

  vidstabtransform for pass 2.


  This filter generates a file with relative translation and rotation

  transform information about subsequent frames, which is then used by

  the vidstabtransform filter.


  To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with

  --enable-libvidstab.


  This filter accepts the following options:'
