<p>Delay video filtering until a given wallclock timestamp. The filter first
passes on <samp>preroll</samp> amount of frames, then it buffers at most
<samp>buffer</samp> amount of frames and waits for the cue. After reaching the cue
it forwards the buffered frames and also any subsequent frames coming in its
input.
</p>
<p>The filter can be used synchronize the output of multiple ffmpeg processes for
realtime output devices like decklink. By putting the delay in the filtering
chain and pre-buffering frames the process can pass on data to output almost
immediately after the target wallclock timestamp is reached.
</p>
<p>Perfect frame accuracy cannot be guaranteed, but the result is good enough for
some use cases.
