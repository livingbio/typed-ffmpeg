<p>Suppress a TV station logo, using an image file to determine which
pixels comprise the logo. It works by filling in the pixels that
comprise the logo with neighboring pixels.
</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>filename, f</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set the filter bitmap file, which can be any image format supported by
libavformat. The width and height of the image file must match those of the
video stream being processed.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Pixels in the provided bitmap image with a value of zero are not
considered part of the logo, non-zero pixels are considered part of
the logo. If you use white (255) for the logo and black (0) for the
rest, you will be safe. For making the filter bitmap, it is
recommended to take a screen capture of a black frame with the logo
visible, and then using a threshold filter followed by the erode
filter once or twice.
</p>
<p>If needed, little splotches can be fixed manually. Remember that if
logo pixels are not covered, the filter quality will be much
reduced. Marking too many pixels as part of the logo does not hurt as
much, but it will increase the amount of blurring needed to cover over
the image and will destroy more information than necessary, and extra
pixels will slow things down on a large logo.
