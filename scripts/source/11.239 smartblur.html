<p>Blur the input video without impacting the outlines.
</p>
<p>It accepts the following options:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>luma_radius, lr</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set the luma radius. The option value must be a float number in
the range [0.1,5.0] that specifies the variance of the gaussian filter
used to blur the image (slower if larger). Default value is 1.0.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>luma_strength, ls</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set the luma strength. The option value must be a float number
in the range [-1.0,1.0] that configures the blurring. A value included
in [0.0,1.0] will blur the image whereas a value included in
[-1.0,0.0] will sharpen the image. Default value is 1.0.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>luma_threshold, lt</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set the luma threshold used as a coefficient to determine
whether a pixel should be blurred or not. The option value must be an
integer in the range [-30,30]. A value of 0 will filter all the image,
a value included in [0,30] will filter flat areas and a value included
in [-30,0] will filter edges. Default value is 0.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>chroma_radius, cr</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set the chroma radius. The option value must be a float number in
the range [0.1,5.0] that specifies the variance of the gaussian filter
used to blur the image (slower if larger). Default value is <samp>luma_radius</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>chroma_strength, cs</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set the chroma strength. The option value must be a float number
in the range [-1.0,1.0] that configures the blurring. A value included
in [0.0,1.0] will blur the image whereas a value included in
[-1.0,0.0] will sharpen the image. Default value is <samp>luma_strength</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>chroma_threshold, ct</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set the chroma threshold used as a coefficient to determine
whether a pixel should be blurred or not. The option value must be an
integer in the range [-30,30]. A value of 0 will filter all the image,
a value included in [0,30] will filter flat areas and a value included
in [-30,0] will filter edges. Default value is <samp>luma_threshold</samp>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>If a chroma option is not explicitly set, the corresponding luma value
is set.
