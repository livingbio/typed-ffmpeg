<p>Buffer video frames, and make them available to the end of the filter
graph.
</p>
<p>This sink is mainly intended for programmatic use, in particular
through the interface defined in <samp>libavfilter/buffersink.h</samp>
or the options system.
</p>
<p>It accepts a pointer to an AVBufferSinkContext structure, which
defines the incoming buffers&rsquo; formats, to be passed as the opaque
parameter to <code>avfilter_init_filter</code> for initialization.
