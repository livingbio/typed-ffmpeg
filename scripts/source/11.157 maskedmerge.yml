  <p>Merge the first input stream with the second input stream using per pixel

  weights in the third input stream.

  </p>

  <p>A value of 0 in the third stream pixel component means that pixel component

  from first stream is returned unchanged, while maximum value (eg. 255 for

  8-bit videos) means that pixel component from second stream is returned

  unchanged. Intermediate values define the amount of merging between both

  input stream&rsquo;s pixel components.
