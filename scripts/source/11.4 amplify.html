<h3 class="section"><a href="#toc-amplify">11.4 amplify</a></h3>

<p>Amplify differences between current pixel and pixels of adjacent frames in
same pixel location.
</p>
<p>This filter accepts the following options:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>radius</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set frame radius. Default is 2. Allowed range is from 1 to 63.
For example radius of 3 will instruct filter to calculate average of 7 frames.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>factor</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set factor to amplify difference. Default is 2. Allowed range is from 0 to 65535.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>threshold</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set threshold for difference amplification. Any difference greater or equal to
this value will not alter source pixel. Default is 10.
Allowed range is from 0 to 65535.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>tolerance</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set tolerance for difference amplification. Any difference lower to
this value will not alter source pixel. Default is 0.
Allowed range is from 0 to 65535.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>low</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set lower limit for changing source pixel. Default is 65535. Allowed range is from 0 to 65535.
This option controls maximum possible value that will decrease source pixel value.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>high</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set high limit for changing source pixel. Default is 65535. Allowed range is from 0 to 65535.
This option controls maximum possible value that will increase source pixel value.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>planes</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set which planes to filter. Default is all. Allowed range is from 0 to 15.
</p></dd>
