description: '8.112 stereowiden

  This filter enhance the stereo effect by suppressing signal common to both

  channels and by delaying the signal of left into right and vice versa,

  thereby widening the stereo effect.


  The filter accepts the following options:'
name: stereowiden
parameters:
- description: '<dd><p>Time in milliseconds of the delay of left signal into right
    and vice versa.

    Default is 20 milliseconds.

    </p>

    </dd>'
  name: delay
- description: '<dd><p>Amount of gain in delayed signal into right and vice versa.
    Gives a delay

    effect of left signal in right output and vice versa which gives widening

    effect. Default is 0.3.

    </p>

    </dd>'
  name: feedback
- description: '<dd><p>Cross feed of left into right with inverted phase. This helps
    in suppressing

    the mono. If the value is 1 it will cancel all the signal common to both

    channels. Default is 0.3.

    </p>

    </dd>'
  name: crossfeed
- description: '<dd><p>Set level of input signal of original channel. Default is 0.8.
