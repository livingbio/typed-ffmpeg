<p>Obtain the identity score between two input videos.
</p>
<p>This filter takes two input videos.
</p>
<p>Both input videos must have the same resolution and pixel format for
this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs
have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.
</p>
<p>The obtained per component, average, min and max identity score is printed through
the logging system.
</p>
<p>The filter stores the calculated identity scores of each frame in frame metadata.
</p>
<p>This filter also supports the <a href="#framesync">framesync</a> options.
</p>
<p>In the below example the input file <samp>main.mpg</samp> being processed is compared
with the reference file <samp>ref.mpg</samp>.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mpg -lavfi identity -f null -
</pre></div>
