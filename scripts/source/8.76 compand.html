<p>Compress or expand the audio&rsquo;s dynamic range.
</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>attacks</samp></dt>
<dt><samp>decays</samp></dt>
<dd><p>A list of times in seconds for each channel over which the instantaneous level
of the input signal is averaged to determine its volume. <var>attacks</var> refers to
increase of volume and <var>decays</var> refers to decrease of volume. For most
situations, the attack time (response to the audio getting louder) should be
shorter than the decay time, because the human ear is more sensitive to sudden
loud audio than sudden soft audio. A typical value for attack is 0.3 seconds and
a typical value for decay is 0.8 seconds.
If specified number of attacks &amp; decays is lower than number of channels, the last
set attack/decay will be used for all remaining channels.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>points</samp></dt>
<dd><p>A list of points for the transfer function, specified in dB relative to the
maximum possible signal amplitude. Each key points list must be defined using
the following syntax: <code>x0/y0|x1/y1|x2/y2|....</code> or
<code>x0/y0 x1/y1 x2/y2 ....</code>
</p>
<p>The input values must be in strictly increasing order but the transfer function
does not have to be monotonically rising. The point <code>0/0</code> is assumed but
may be overridden (by <code>0/out-dBn</code>). Typical values for the transfer
function are <code>-70/-70|-60/-20|1/0</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>soft-knee</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set the curve radius in dB for all joints. It defaults to 0.01.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>gain</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set the additional gain in dB to be applied at all points on the transfer
function. This allows for easy adjustment of the overall gain.
It defaults to 0.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>volume</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set an initial volume, in dB, to be assumed for each channel when filtering
starts. This permits the user to supply a nominal level initially, so that, for
example, a very large gain is not applied to initial signal levels before the
companding has begun to operate. A typical value for audio which is initially
quiet is -90 dB. It defaults to 0.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>delay</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set a delay, in seconds. The input audio is analyzed immediately, but audio is
delayed before being fed to the volume adjuster. Specifying a delay
approximately equal to the attack/decay times allows the filter to effectively
operate in predictive rather than reactive mode. It defaults to 0.
