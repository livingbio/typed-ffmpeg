  <p>A compressor is mainly used to reduce the dynamic range of a signal.

  Especially modern music is mostly compressed at a high ratio to

  improve the overall loudness. It&rsquo;s done to get the highest attention

  of a listener, &quot;fatten&quot; the sound and bring more &quot;power&quot; to
  the track.

  If a signal is compressed too much it may sound dull or &quot;dead&quot;

  afterwards or it may start to &quot;pump&quot; (which could be a powerful effect

  but can also destroy a track completely).

  The right compression is the key to reach a professional sound and is

  the high art of mixing and mastering. Because of its complex settings

  it may take a long time to get the right feeling for this kind of effect.

  </p>

  <p>Compression is done by detecting the volume above a chosen level

  <code>threshold</code> and dividing it by the factor set with <code>ratio</code>.

  So if you set the threshold to -12dB and your signal reaches -6dB a ratio

  of 2:1 will result in a signal at -9dB. Because an exact manipulation of

  the signal would cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be

  levelled over the time. This is done by setting &quot;Attack&quot; and &quot;Release&quot;.

  <code>attack</code> determines how long the signal has to rise above the threshold

  before any reduction will occur and <code>release</code> sets the time the signal

  has to fall below the threshold to reduce the reduction again. Shorter signals

  than the chosen attack time will be left untouched.

  The overall reduction of the signal can be made up afterwards with the

  <code>makeup</code> setting. So compressing the peaks of a signal about 6dB and

  raising the makeup to this level results in a signal twice as loud than the

  source. To gain a softer entry in the compression the <code>knee</code> flattens
  the

  hard edge at the threshold in the range of the chosen decibels.
