description: '11.260 tonemap

  Tone map colors from different dynamic ranges.


  This filter expects data in single precision floating point, as it needs to

  operate on (and can output) out-of-range values. Another filter, such as

  zscale, is needed to convert the resulting frame to a usable format.


  The tonemapping algorithms implemented only work on linear light, so input

  data should be linearized beforehand (and possibly correctly tagged).
