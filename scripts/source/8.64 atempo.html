<p>Adjust audio tempo.
</p>
<p>The filter accepts exactly one parameter, the audio tempo. If not
specified then the filter will assume nominal 1.0 tempo. Tempo must
be in the [0.5, 100.0] range.
</p>
<p>Note that tempo greater than 2 will skip some samples rather than
blend them in.  If for any reason this is a concern it is always
possible to daisy-chain several instances of atempo to achieve the
desired product tempo.
