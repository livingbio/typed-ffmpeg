<p>A compressor is mainly used to reduce the dynamic range of a signal.
Especially modern music is mostly compressed at a high ratio to
improve the overall loudness. It&rsquo;s done to get the highest attention
of a listener, &quot;fatten&quot; the sound and bring more &quot;power&quot; to the track.
If a signal is compressed too much it may sound dull or &quot;dead&quot;
afterwards or it may start to &quot;pump&quot; (which could be a powerful effect
but can also destroy a track completely).
The right compression is the key to reach a professional sound and is
the high art of mixing and mastering. Because of its complex settings
it may take a long time to get the right feeling for this kind of effect.
</p>
<p>Compression is done by detecting the volume above a chosen level
<code>threshold</code> and dividing it by the factor set with <code>ratio</code>.
So if you set the threshold to -12dB and your signal reaches -6dB a ratio
of 2:1 will result in a signal at -9dB. Because an exact manipulation of
the signal would cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be
levelled over the time. This is done by setting &quot;Attack&quot; and &quot;Release&quot;.
<code>attack</code> determines how long the signal has to rise above the threshold
before any reduction will occur and <code>release</code> sets the time the signal
has to fall below the threshold to reduce the reduction again. Shorter signals
than the chosen attack time will be left untouched.
The overall reduction of the signal can be made up afterwards with the
<code>makeup</code> setting. So compressing the peaks of a signal about 6dB and
raising the makeup to this level results in a signal twice as loud than the
source. To gain a softer entry in the compression the <code>knee</code> flattens the
hard edge at the threshold in the range of the chosen decibels.

<p>The filter accepts the following options:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>level_in</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set input gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625 and 64.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>mode</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set mode of compressor operation. Can be <code>upward</code> or <code>downward</code>.
Default is <code>downward</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>threshold</samp></dt>
<dd><p>If a signal of stream rises above this level it will affect the gain
reduction.
By default it is 0.125. Range is between 0.00097563 and 1.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>ratio</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set a ratio by which the signal is reduced. 1:2 means that if the level
rose 4dB above the threshold, it will be only 2dB above after the reduction.
Default is 2. Range is between 1 and 20.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>attack</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain
reduction starts. Default is 20. Range is between 0.01 and 2000.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>release</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before
reduction is decreased again. Default is 250. Range is between 0.01 and 9000.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>makeup</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set the amount by how much signal will be amplified after processing.
Default is 1. Range is from 1 to 64.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>knee</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly.
Default is 2.82843. Range is between 1 and 8.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>link</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Choose if the <code>average</code> level between all channels of input stream
or the louder(<code>maximum</code>) channel of input stream affects the
reduction. Default is <code>average</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>detection</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Should the exact signal be taken in case of <code>peak</code> or an RMS one in case
of <code>rms</code>. Default is <code>rms</code> which is mostly smoother.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>mix</samp></dt>
<dd><p>How much to use compressed signal in output. Default is 1.
Range is between 0 and 1.
</p></dd>
