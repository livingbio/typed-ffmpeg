  Pick pixels comparing absolute difference of two video streams with fixed

  threshold.


  If absolute difference between pixel component of first and second video

  stream is equal or lower than user supplied threshold than pixel component

  from first video stream is picked, otherwise pixel component from second

  video stream is picked.


  This filter accepts the following options:'

parameters:

    from two input

    video streams.
