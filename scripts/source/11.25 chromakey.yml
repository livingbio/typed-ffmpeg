  YUV colorspace color/chroma keying.


  The filter accepts the following options:'
name: chromakey
parameters:
- description: '<dd><p>The color which will be replaced with transparency.

    </p>

    </dd>'
  name: color
- description: '<dd><p>Similarity percentage with the key color.

    </p>

    <p>0.01 matches only the exact key color, while 1.0 matches everything.

    </p>

    </dd>'
  name: similarity
- description: '<dd><p>Blend percentage.

    </p>

    <p>0.0 makes pixels either fully transparent, or not transparent at all.

    </p>

    <p>Higher values result in semi-transparent pixels, with a higher transparency

    the more similar the pixels color is to the key color.
