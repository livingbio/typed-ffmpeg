<p>Detect the volume of the input video.
</p>
<p>The filter has no parameters. It supports only 16-bit signed integer samples,
so the input will be converted when needed. Statistics about the volume will
be printed in the log when the input stream end is reached.
</p>
<p>In particular it will show the mean volume (root mean square), maximum
volume (on a per-sample basis), and the beginning of a histogram of the
registered volume values (from the maximum value to a cumulated 1/1000 of
the samples).
</p>
<p>All volumes are in decibels relative to the maximum PCM value.
