  <p>Detect video intervals that are (almost) completely black. Can be

  useful to detect chapter transitions, commercials, or invalid

  recordings.

  </p>

  <p>The filter outputs its detection analysis to both the log as well as

  frame metadata. If a black segment of at least the specified minimum

  duration is found, a line with the start and end timestamps as well

  as duration is printed to the log with level <code>info</code>. In addition,

  a log line with level <code>debug</code> is printed per frame showing the

  black amount detected for that frame.

  </p>

  <p>The filter also attaches metadata to the first frame of a black

  segment with key <code>lavfi.black_start</code> and to the first frame

  after the black segment ends with key <code>lavfi.black_end</code>. The

  value is the frame&rsquo;s timestamp. This metadata is added regardless

  of the minimum duration specified.

  </p>

  <p>The filter accepts the following options:

  </p>

  <dl compact="compact">

  <dt><samp>black_min_duration, d</samp></dt>

  <dd><p>Set the minimum detected black duration expressed in seconds. It must

  be a non-negative floating point number.

  <p>Default value is 2.0.

  <p>The threshold expresses the maximum pixel luma value for which a

  pixel is considered &quot;black&quot;. The provided value is scaled according to

  the following equation:

  </p><div class="example">

  <p>The following example sets the maximum pixel threshold to the minimum

  value, and detects only black intervals of 2 or more seconds:
