  <p>Apply Midway Image Equalization effect using two video streams.

  </p>

  <p>Midway Image Equalization adjusts a pair of images to have the same

  histogram, while maintaining their dynamics as much as possible. It&rsquo;s

  useful for e.g. matching exposures from a pair of stereo cameras.

  </p>

  <p>This filter has two inputs and one output, which must be of same pixel format,
  but

  may be of different sizes. The output of filter is first input adjusted with

  midway histogram of both inputs.

  <p>This filter accepts the following option:
