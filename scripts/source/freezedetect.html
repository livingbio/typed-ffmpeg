<p>Detect frozen video.
</p>
<p>This filter logs a message and sets frame metadata when it detects that the
input video has no significant change in content during a specified duration.
Video freeze detection calculates the mean average absolute difference of all
the components of video frames and compares it to a noise floor.
</p>
<p>The printed times and duration are expressed in seconds. The
<code>lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_start</code> metadata key is set on the first frame
whose timestamp equals or exceeds the detection duration and it contains the
timestamp of the first frame of the freeze. The
<code>lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_duration</code> and
<code>lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_end</code> metadata keys are set on the first frame
after the freeze.
</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>noise, n</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set noise tolerance. Can be specified in dB (in case &quot;dB&quot; is appended to the
specified value) or as a difference ratio between 0 and 1. Default is -60dB, or
0.001.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>duration, d</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set freeze duration until notification (default is 2 seconds).
</p></dd>
