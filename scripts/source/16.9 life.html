<p>Generate a life pattern.
</p>
<p>This source is based on a generalization of John Conway&rsquo;s life game.
</p>
<p>The sourced input represents a life grid, each pixel represents a cell
which can be in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell
interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
</p>
<p>At each interaction the grid evolves according to the adopted rule,
which specifies the number of neighbor alive cells which will make a
cell stay alive or born. The <samp>rule</samp> option allows one to specify
the rule to adopt.
</p>
<p>This source accepts the following options:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>filename, f</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set the file from which to read the initial grid state. In the file,
each non-whitespace character is considered an alive cell, and newline
is used to delimit the end of each row.
</p>
<p>If this option is not specified, the initial grid is generated
randomly.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>rate, r</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set the video rate, that is the number of frames generated per second.
Default is 25.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>random_fill_ratio, ratio</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set the random fill ratio for the initial random grid. It is a
floating point number value ranging from 0 to 1, defaults to 1/PHI.
It is ignored when a file is specified.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>random_seed, seed</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set the seed for filling the initial random grid, must be an integer
included between 0 and UINT32_MAX. If not specified, or if explicitly
set to -1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best
effort basis.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>rule</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set the life rule.
</p>
<p>A rule can be specified with a code of the kind &quot;S<var>NS</var>/B<var>NB</var>&quot;,
where <var>NS</var> and <var>NB</var> are sequences of numbers in the range 0-8,
<var>NS</var> specifies the number of alive neighbor cells which make a
live cell stay alive, and <var>NB</var> the number of alive neighbor cells
which make a dead cell to become alive (i.e. to &quot;born&quot;).
&quot;s&quot; and &quot;b&quot; can be used in place of &quot;S&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, respectively.
</p>
<p>Alternatively a rule can be specified by an 18-bits integer. The 9
high order bits are used to encode the next cell state if it is alive
for each number of neighbor alive cells, the low order bits specify
the rule for &quot;borning&quot; new cells. Higher order bits encode for an
higher number of neighbor cells.
For example the number 6153 = <code>(12&lt;&lt;9)+9</code> specifies a stay alive
rule of 12 and a born rule of 9, which corresponds to &quot;S23/B03&quot;.
</p>
<p>Default value is &quot;S23/B3&quot;, which is the original Conway&rsquo;s game of life
rule, and will keep a cell alive if it has 2 or 3 neighbor alive
cells, and will born a new cell if there are three alive cells around
a dead cell.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>size, s</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set the size of the output video. For the syntax of this option, check the
<a href="ffmpeg-utils.html#video-size-syntax">(ffmpeg-utils)&quot;Video size&quot; section in the ffmpeg-utils manual</a>.
</p>
<p>If <samp>filename</samp> is specified, the size is set by default to the
same size of the input file. If <samp>size</samp> is set, it must contain
the size specified in the input file, and the initial grid defined in
that file is centered in the larger resulting area.
</p>
<p>If a filename is not specified, the size value defaults to &quot;320x240&quot;
(used for a randomly generated initial grid).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>stitch</samp></dt>
<dd><p>If set to 1, stitch the left and right grid edges together, and the
top and bottom edges also. Defaults to 1.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>mold</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set cell mold speed. If set, a dead cell will go from <samp>death_color</samp> to
<samp>mold_color</samp> with a step of <samp>mold</samp>. <samp>mold</samp> can have a
value from 0 to 255.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>life_color</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set the color of living (or new born) cells.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>death_color</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set the color of dead cells. If <samp>mold</samp> is set, this is the first color
used to represent a dead cell.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>mold_color</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set mold color, for definitely dead and moldy cells.
</p>
<p>For the syntax of these 3 color options, check the <a href="ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax">(ffmpeg-utils)&quot;Color&quot; section in the
ffmpeg-utils manual</a>.
