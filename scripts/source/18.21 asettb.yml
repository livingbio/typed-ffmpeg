description: '18.21 settb, asettb

  Set the timebase to use for the output frames timestamps.

  It is mainly useful for testing timebase configuration.


  It accepts the following parameters:



  The value for tb is an arithmetic expression representing a

  rational. The expression can contain the constants "AVTB" (the default

  timebase), "intb" (the input timebase) and "sr" (the sample rate,

  audio only). Default value is "intb".'
