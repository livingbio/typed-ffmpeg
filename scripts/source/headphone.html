<p>Apply head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) to create virtual
loudspeakers around the user for binaural listening via headphones.
The HRIRs are provided via additional streams, for each channel
one stereo input stream is needed.
</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>map</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set mapping of input streams for convolution.
The argument is a &rsquo;|&rsquo;-separated list of channel names in order as they
are given as additional stream inputs for filter.
This also specify number of input streams. Number of input streams
must be not less than number of channels in first stream plus one.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>gain</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set gain applied to audio. Value is in dB. Default is 0.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>type</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set processing type. Can be <var>time</var> or <var>freq</var>. <var>time</var> is
processing audio in time domain which is slow.
<var>freq</var> is processing audio in frequency domain which is fast.
Default is <var>freq</var>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>lfe</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set custom gain for LFE channels. Value is in dB. Default is 0.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>size</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set size of frame in number of samples which will be processed at once.
Default value is <var>1024</var>. Allowed range is from 1024 to 96000.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>hrir</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set format of hrir stream.
Default value is <var>stereo</var>. Alternative value is <var>multich</var>.
If value is set to <var>stereo</var>, number of additional streams should
be greater or equal to number of input channels in first input stream.
Also each additional stream should have stereo number of channels.
If value is set to <var>multich</var>, number of additional streams should
be exactly one. Also number of input channels of additional stream
should be equal or greater than twice number of channels of first input
stream.
