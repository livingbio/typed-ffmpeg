<p>A gate is mainly used to reduce lower parts of a signal. This kind of signal
processing reduces disturbing noise between useful signals.
</p>
<p>Gating is done by detecting the volume below a chosen level <var>threshold</var>
and dividing it by the factor set with <var>ratio</var>. The bottom of the noise
floor is set via <var>range</var>. Because an exact manipulation of the signal
would cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be levelled over
time. This is done by setting <var>attack</var> and <var>release</var>.
</p>
<p><var>attack</var> determines how long the signal has to fall below the threshold
before any reduction will occur and <var>release</var> sets the time the signal
has to rise above the threshold to reduce the reduction again.
Shorter signals than the chosen attack time will be left untouched.

<dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>level_in</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set input level before filtering.
Default is 1. Allowed range is from 0.015625 to 64.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>mode</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set the mode of operation. Can be <code>upward</code> or <code>downward</code>.
Default is <code>downward</code>. If set to <code>upward</code> mode, higher parts of signal
will be amplified, expanding dynamic range in upward direction.
Otherwise, in case of <code>downward</code> lower parts of signal will be reduced.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>range</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set the level of gain reduction when the signal is below the threshold.
Default is 0.06125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.
Setting this to 0 disables reduction and then filter behaves like expander.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>threshold</samp></dt>
<dd><p>If a signal rises above this level the gain reduction is released.
Default is 0.125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>ratio</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set a ratio by which the signal is reduced.
Default is 2. Allowed range is from 1 to 9000.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>attack</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain
reduction stops.
Default is 20 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>release</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before the
reduction is increased again. Default is 250 milliseconds.
Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>makeup</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set amount of amplification of signal after processing.
Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 64.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>knee</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly.
Default is 2.828427125. Allowed range is from 1 to 8.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>detection</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Choose if exact signal should be taken for detection or an RMS like one.
Default is <code>rms</code>. Can be <code>peak</code> or <code>rms</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>link</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Choose if the average level between all channels or the louder channel affects
the reduction.
Default is <code>average</code>. Can be <code>average</code> or <code>maximum</code>.
