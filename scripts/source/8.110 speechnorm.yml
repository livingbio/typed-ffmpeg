  Speech Normalizer.


  This filter expands or compresses each half-cycle of audio samples

  (local set of samples all above or all below zero and between two nearest zero crossings)
  depending

  on threshold value, so audio reaches target peak value under conditions controlled
  by below options.


  The filter accepts the following options:'

    allowed absolute amplitude

    level for the normalized audio input. Default value is 0.95. Allowed range is

    This option controls maximum local half-cycle of samples expansion. The maximum

    would be such that local peak value reaches target peak value but never to surpass
    it and that

    ratio between new and previous peak value does not surpass this option value.
