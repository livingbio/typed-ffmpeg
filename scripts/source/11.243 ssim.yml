  Obtain the SSIM (Structural SImilarity Metric) between two input videos.


  This filter takes in input two input videos, the first input is

  considered the "main" source and is passed unchanged to the

  output. The second input is used as a "reference" video for computing

  the SSIM.


  Both video inputs must have the same resolution and pixel format for

  this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs

  have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.


  The filter stores the calculated SSIM of each frame.
