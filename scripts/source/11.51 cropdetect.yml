description: '11.51 cropdetect

  Auto-detect the crop size.


  It calculates the necessary cropping parameters and prints the

  recommended parameters via the logging system. The detected dimensions

  correspond to the non-black or video area of the input video according to mode.


  It accepts the following parameters:'
