- description: '<dd><p>Specify a fixed size grid of inputs.

    This option is used to create a fixed size grid of the input streams. Set the

    grid size in the form <code>COLUMNSxROWS</code>. There must be <code>ROWS * COLUMNS</code>

    input streams and they will be arranged as a grid with <code>ROWS</code> rows
    and

    <code>COLUMNS</code> columns. When using this option, each input stream within
    a row

    must have the same height and all the rows must have the same width.

    </p>

    <p>If <code>grid</code> is set, then <code>inputs</code> option is ignored and
    is implicitly

    set to <code>ROWS * COLUMNS</code>.

    </p>

    <p>For 2 inputs, a default grid of <code>2x1</code> (equivalent to

    <code>layout=0_0|w0_0</code>) is set. In all other cases, a layout or a grid must
    be

    set by the user. Either <code>grid</code> or <code>layout</code> can be specified
    at a time.

    Specifying both will result in an error.

  <p>Stack video inputs into custom layout.

  <p>All streams must be of same pixel format.

  </p>

  <p>The filter accepts the following options:

  </p>

  <dl compact="compact">

  <dt><samp>inputs</samp></dt>

  <dd><p>Set number of input streams. Default is 2.

  </p>

  </dd>

  <dt><samp>layout</samp></dt>

  <dd><p>Specify layout of inputs.

  This option requires the desired layout configuration to be explicitly set by the
  user.

  This sets position of each video input in output. Each input

  is separated by &rsquo;|&rsquo;.

  The first number represents the column, and the second number represents the row.

  Numbers start at 0 and are separated by &rsquo;_&rsquo;. Optionally one can use
  wX and hX,

  where X is video input from which to take width or height.

  Multiple values can be used when separated by &rsquo;+&rsquo;. In such

  case values are summed together.

  </p>

  <p>Note that if inputs are of different sizes gaps may appear, as not all of

  the output video frame will be filled. Similarly, videos can overlap each

  other if their position doesn&rsquo;t leave enough space for the full frame of

  adjoining videos.

  </p>

  <p>For 2 inputs, a default layout of <code>0_0|w0_0</code> (equivalent to

  <code>grid=2x1</code>) is set. In all other cases, a layout or a grid must be set
  by

  the user. Either <code>grid</code> or <code>layout</code> can be specified at a
  time.

  Specifying both will result in an error.
