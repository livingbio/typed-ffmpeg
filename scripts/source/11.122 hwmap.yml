  <p>Map hardware frames to system memory or to another device.

  </p>

  <p>This filter has several different modes of operation; which one is used depends

  on the input and output formats:

  </p><ul>

  <li> Hardware frame input, normal frame output


  <p>Map the input frames to system memory and pass them to the output.  If the

  original hardware frame is later required (for example, after overlaying

  something else on part of it), the <samp>hwmap</samp> filter can be used again

  in the next mode to retrieve it.

  </p></li><li> Normal frame input, hardware frame output


  <p>If the input is actually a software-mapped hardware frame, then unmap it -

  that is, return the original hardware frame.

  </p>

  <p>Otherwise, a device must be provided.  Create new hardware surfaces on that

  device for the output, then map them back to the software format at the input

  and give those frames to the preceding filter.  This will then act like the

  <samp>hwupload</samp> filter, but may be able to avoid an additional copy when

  the input is already in a compatible format.

  </p></li><li> Hardware frame input and output


  <p>A device must be supplied for the output, either directly or with the

  <samp>derive_device</samp> option.  The input and output devices must be of

  different types and compatible - the exact meaning of this is

  system-dependent, but typically it means that they must refer to the same

  underlying hardware context (for example, refer to the same graphics card).

  </p>

  <p>If the input frames were originally created on the output device, then unmap

  to retrieve the original frames.

  </p>

  <p>Otherwise, map the frames to the output device - create new hardware frames

  on the output corresponding to the frames on the input.

  </p></li></ul>

  device of type <var>type</var> from the device the input frames exist on.

  </p>

  </dd>

  <dt><samp>reverse</samp></dt>

  <dd><p>In a hardware to hardware mapping, map in reverse - create frames in the
  sink

  and map them back to the source.  This may be necessary in some cases where

  a mapping in one direction is required but only the opposite direction is

  supported by the devices being used.

  </p>

  <p>This option is dangerous - it may break the preceding filter in undefined

  ways if there are any additional constraints on that filter&rsquo;s output.

  Do not use it without fully understanding the implications of its use.
