description: '8.29 agate

  A gate is mainly used to reduce lower parts of a signal. This kind of signal

  processing reduces disturbing noise between useful signals.


  Gating is done by detecting the volume below a chosen level threshold

  and dividing it by the factor set with ratio. The bottom of the noise

  floor is set via range. Because an exact manipulation of the signal

  would cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be levelled over

  time. This is done by setting attack and release.


  attack determines how long the signal has to fall below the threshold

  before any reduction will occur and release sets the time the signal

  has to rise above the threshold to reduce the reduction again.

  Shorter signals than the chosen attack time will be left untouched.'
