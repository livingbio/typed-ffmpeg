<p>What happens when you invert time and space?
</p>
<p>Normally a video is composed of several frames that represent a different
instant of time and shows a scence that evolves in the space captured by the
frame. This filter is the antipode of that concept, taking inspiration by
tilt and shift photography.
</p>
<p>A filtered frame contains the whole timeline of events composing the sequence,
and this is obtained by placing a slice of pixels from each frame into a single
one. However, since there are no infinite-width frames, this is done up the
width of the input frame, and a video is recomposed by shifting away one
column for each subsequent frame. In order to map space to time, the filter
tilts each input frame as well, so that motion is preseved. This is accomplished
by progressively selecting a different column from each input frame.
</p>
<p>The end result is a sort of inverted parralax, so that far away objects move
much faster that the ones in the front. The ideal conditions for this video
effect are when there is either very little motion and the backgroud is static,
or when there is a lot of motion and a very wide depth of field (eg. wide
panorama, while moving on a train).
</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following parameters:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>tilt</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Tilt video while shifting (default). When unset, video will be sliding a
static image, composed of the first column of each frame.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>start</samp></dt>
<dd><p>What to do at the start of filtering (see below).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>end</samp></dt>
<dd><p>What to do at the end of filtering (see below).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>hold</samp></dt>
<dd><p>How many columns should pass through before start of filtering.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>pad</samp></dt>
<dd><p>How many columns should be inserted before end of filtering.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Normally the filter shifts and tils from the very first frame, and stops when
the last one is received. However, before filtering starts, normal video may
be preseved, so that the effect is slowly shifted in its place. Similarly,
the last video frame may be reconstructed at the end. Alternatively it is
possible to just start and end with black.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>none</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Filtering is starts immediately and ends when the last frame is received.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>frame</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>The first frames or the very last frame are kept intact during processing.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>black</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Black is padded at the beginning or at the end of filtering.
