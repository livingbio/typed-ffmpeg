<p>Add or replace the alpha component of the primary input with the
grayscale value of a second input. This is intended for use with
<var>alphaextract</var> to allow the transmission or storage of frame
sequences that have alpha in a format that doesn&rsquo;t support an alpha
channel.
</p>
<p>For example, to reconstruct full frames from a normal YUV-encoded video
and a separate video created with <var>alphaextract</var>, you might use:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">movie=in_alpha.mkv [alpha]; [in][alpha] alphamerge [out]
</pre></div>
