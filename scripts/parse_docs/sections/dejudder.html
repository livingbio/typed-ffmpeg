<p>Remove judder produced by partially interlaced telecined content.
</p>
<p>Judder can be introduced, for instance, by <a href="#pullup">pullup</a> filter. If the original
source was partially telecined content then the output of <code>pullup,dejudder</code>
will have a variable frame rate. May change the recorded frame rate of the
container. Aside from that change, this filter will not affect constant frame
rate video.
</p>
<p>The option available in this filter is:
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>cycle</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Specify the length of the window over which the judder repeats.
</p>
<p>Accepts any integer greater than 1. Useful values are:
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>4</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>If the original was telecined from 24 to 30 fps (Film to NTSC).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>5</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>If the original was telecined from 25 to 30 fps (PAL to NTSC).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>20</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>If a mixture of the two.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The default is &lsquo;<samp>4</samp>&rsquo;.
</p></dd>
</dl>
