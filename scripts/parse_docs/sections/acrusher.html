<p>Reduce audio bit resolution.
</p>
<p>This filter is bit crusher with enhanced functionality. A bit crusher
is used to audibly reduce number of bits an audio signal is sampled
with. This doesn&rsquo;t change the bit depth at all, it just produces the
effect. Material reduced in bit depth sounds more harsh and &quot;digital&quot;.
This filter is able to even round to continuous values instead of discrete
bit depths.
Additionally it has a D/C offset which results in different crushing of
the lower and the upper half of the signal.
An Anti-Aliasing setting is able to produce &quot;softer&quot; crushing sounds.
</p>
<p>Another feature of this filter is the logarithmic mode.
This setting switches from linear distances between bits to logarithmic ones.
The result is a much more &quot;natural&quot; sounding crusher which doesn&rsquo;t gate low
signals for example. The human ear has a logarithmic perception,
so this kind of crushing is much more pleasant.
Logarithmic crushing is also able to get anti-aliased.
