# NodeMapping Enhanced Tests

This folder contains enhanced tests for the NodeMappingManager class. The enhanced tests improve on the original tests in several ways:

## Improvements

1. **Better Error Handling Tests**
   - Tests for error cases when inputs are missing
   - Tests for error cases with invalid parameters
   - Tests for appropriate error messages

2. **Event Handling Tests**
   - Verifies that update events fire correctly
   - Tests proper event unsubscription

3. **Edge Case Coverage**
   - Tests for dynamic filter typings
   - Tests for formula evaluation failures
   - Tests for type compatibility enforcement

4. **Structured Test Organization**
   - Organized by functionality (Node Management, Edge Management, etc.)
   - Clearly separated sub-tests for adding, removing, and updating
   - Better test descriptions

5. **Mocking and Isolation**
   - Mocked `evaluateFormula` to reduce dependencies
   - Mocked filter definitions for deterministic testing

## Usage

Run these tests with:

```bash
npm run test -- nodeMapping.enhanced.test.ts
```

Or run them alongside the original tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Implementation Notes

- The enhanced tests avoid modifying the original `nodeMapping.ts` file
- Tests focus on validating the public API behavior
- Direct access to class properties is done via Array.from() to avoid assuming structure details
- All asynchronous operations are properly handled with async/await

## Future Improvements

1. Add more complex graph structure tests
2. Test circular dependency detection
3. Add performance benchmarks for large graphs
4. Add tests for concurrent modifications
