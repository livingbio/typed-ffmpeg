<p>Fix the banding artifacts that are sometimes introduced into nearly flat
regions by truncation to 8-bit color depth.
Interpolate the gradients that should go where the bands are, and
dither them.
</p>
<p>It is designed for playback only.  Do not use it prior to
lossy compression, because compression tends to lose the dither and
bring back the bands.
</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>strength</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The maximum amount by which the filter will change any one pixel. This is also
the threshold for detecting nearly flat regions. Acceptable values range from
.51 to 64; the default value is 1.2. Out-of-range values will be clipped to the
valid range.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>radius</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The neighborhood to fit the gradient to. A larger radius makes for smoother
gradients, but also prevents the filter from modifying the pixels near detailed
regions. Acceptable values are 8-32; the default value is 16. Out-of-range
values will be clipped to the valid range.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string:
<var>strength</var>[:<var>radius</var>]
</p>
