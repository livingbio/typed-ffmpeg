<p>Merge the first input stream with the second input stream using per pixel
weights in the third input stream.
</p>
<p>A value of 0 in the third stream pixel component means that pixel component
from first stream is returned unchanged, while maximum value (eg. 255 for
8-bit videos) means that pixel component from second stream is returned
unchanged. Intermediate values define the amount of merging between both
input stream&rsquo;s pixel components.
</p>
<p>This filter accepts the following options:
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>planes</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Set which planes will be processed as bitmap, unprocessed planes will be
copied from first stream.
By default value 0xf, all planes will be processed.
</p></dd>
