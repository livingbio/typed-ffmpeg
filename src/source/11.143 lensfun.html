<p>Apply lens correction via the lensfun library (<a href="http://lensfun.sourceforge.net/">http://lensfun.sourceforge.net/</a>).
</p>
<p>The <code>lensfun</code> filter requires the camera make, camera model, and lens model
to apply the lens correction. The filter will load the lensfun database and
query it to find the corresponding camera and lens entries in the database. As
long as these entries can be found with the given options, the filter can
perform corrections on frames. Note that incomplete strings will result in the
filter choosing the best match with the given options, and the filter will
output the chosen camera and lens models (logged with level &quot;info&quot;). You must
provide the make, camera model, and lens model as they are required.
</p>
<p>To obtain a list of available makes and models, leave out one or both of <code>make</code> and
<code>model</code> options. The filter will send the full list to the log with level <code>INFO</code>.
The first column is the make and the second column is the model.
To obtain a list of available lenses, set any values for make and model and leave out the
<code>lens_model</code> option. The filter will send the full list of lenses in the log with level
<code>INFO</code>. The ffmpeg tool will exit after the list is printed.
</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>make</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The make of the camera (for example, &quot;Canon&quot;). This option is required.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>model</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The model of the camera (for example, &quot;Canon EOS 100D&quot;). This option is
required.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>lens_model</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The model of the lens (for example, &quot;Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM&quot;). This
option is required.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>db_path</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The full path to the lens database folder. If not set, the filter will attempt to
load the database from the install path when the library was built. Default is unset.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>mode</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The type of correction to apply. The following values are valid options:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>vignetting</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Enables fixing lens vignetting.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>geometry</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Enables fixing lens geometry. This is the default.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>subpixel</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Enables fixing chromatic aberrations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>vig_geo</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Enables fixing lens vignetting and lens geometry.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>vig_subpixel</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Enables fixing lens vignetting and chromatic aberrations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>distortion</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Enables fixing both lens geometry and chromatic aberrations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>all</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Enables all possible corrections.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><samp>focal_length</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The focal length of the image/video (zoom; expected constant for video). For
example, a 18&ndash;55mm lens has focal length range of [18&ndash;55], so a value in that
range should be chosen when using that lens. Default 18.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>aperture</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The aperture of the image/video (expected constant for video). Note that
aperture is only used for vignetting correction. Default 3.5.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>focus_distance</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The focus distance of the image/video (expected constant for video). Note that
focus distance is only used for vignetting and only slightly affects the
vignetting correction process. If unknown, leave it at the default value (which
is 1000).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>scale</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The scale factor which is applied after transformation. After correction the
video is no longer necessarily rectangular. This parameter controls how much of
the resulting image is visible. The value 0 means that a value will be chosen
automatically such that there is little or no unmapped area in the output
image. 1.0 means that no additional scaling is done. Lower values may result
in more of the corrected image being visible, while higher values may avoid
unmapped areas in the output.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>target_geometry</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The target geometry of the output image/video. The following values are valid
options:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>rectilinear (default)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>fisheye</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>panoramic</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>equirectangular</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>fisheye_orthographic</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>fisheye_stereographic</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>fisheye_equisolid</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>fisheye_thoby</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><samp>reverse</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Apply the reverse of image correction (instead of correcting distortion, apply
it).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>interpolation</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The type of interpolation used when correcting distortion. The following values
are valid options:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>nearest</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>linear (default)</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>lanczos</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
