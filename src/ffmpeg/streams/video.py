        ### 11.1 addroi

        Mark a region of interest in a video frame.

        The frame data is passed through unchanged, but metadata is attached to the
        frame indicating regions of interest which can affect the behaviour of later
        encoding. Multiple regions can be marked by applying the filter multiple
        times.

        **x**

            Region distance in pixels from the left edge of the frame.

        **y**

            Region distance in pixels from the top edge of the frame.

        **w**

            Region width in pixels.

        **h**

            Region height in pixels. The parameters x, y, w and h are expressions, and may contain the following variables: iw Width of the input frame. ih Height of the input frame.

        **qoffset**

            Quantisation offset to apply within the region. This must be a real value in the range -1 to +1. A value of zero indicates no quality change. A negative value asks for better quality (less quantisation), while a positive value asks for worse quality (greater quantisation). The range is calibrated so that the extreme values indicate the largest possible offset - if the rest of the frame is encoded with the worst possible quality, an offset of -1 indicates that this region should be encoded with the best possible quality anyway. Intermediate values are then interpolated in some codec-dependent way. For example, in 10-bit H.264 the quantisation parameter varies between -12 and 51. A typical qoffset value of -1/10 therefore indicates that this region should be encoded with a QP around one-tenth of the full range better than the rest of the frame. So, if most of the frame were to be encoded with a QP of around 30, this region would get a QP of around 24 (an offset of approximately -1/10 * (51 - -12) = -6.3). An extreme value of -1 would indicate that this region should be encoded with the best possible quality regardless of the treatment of the rest of the frame - that is, should be encoded at a QP of -12.

        **clear**

            If set to true, remove any existing regions of interest marked on the frame before adding the new one.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param str x: Region distance in pixels from the left edge of the frame.
        :param str y: Region distance in pixels from the top edge of the frame.

        :param str h: Region height in pixels. The parameters x, y, w and h are expressions, and may contain the following variables: iw Width of the input frame. ih Height of the input frame.

            Set what variant of algorithm filter will use for averaging. Default is p parallel. Alternatively can be set to s serial. Parallel can be faster then serial, while other way around is never true. Parallel will abort early on first change being greater then thresholds, while serial will continue processing other side of frames if they are equal or below thresholds.

        **1s**

        **2s**

            Set sigma for 1st plane, 2nd plane or 3rd plane. Default is 32767. Valid range is from 0 to 32767. This options controls weight for each pixel in radius defined by size. Default value means every pixel have same weight. Setting this option to 0 effectively disables filtering.

        ### 11.13 blackdetect

        Detect video intervals that are (almost) completely black. Can be useful to
        detect chapter transitions, commercials, or invalid recordings.

        The filter outputs its detection analysis to both the log as well as frame
        metadata. If a black segment of at least the specified minimum duration is
        found, a line with the start and end timestamps as well as duration is printed
        to the log with level `info`. In addition, a log line with level `debug` is
        printed per frame showing the black amount detected for that frame.

        The filter also attaches metadata to the first frame of a black segment with
        key `lavfi.black_start` and to the first frame after the black segment ends
        with key `lavfi.black_end`. The value is the frame’s timestamp. This metadata
        is added regardless of the minimum duration specified.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **black_min_duration, d**

            Set the minimum detected black duration expressed in seconds. It must be a non-negative floating point number. Default value is 2.0.

        **picture_black_ratio_th, pic_th**

            Set the threshold for considering a picture "black". Express the minimum value for the ratio: nb_black_pixels / nb_pixels for which a picture is considered black. Default value is 0.98.

        **pixel_black_th, pix_th**

            Set the threshold for considering a pixel "black". The threshold expresses the maximum pixel luma value for which a pixel is considered "black". The provided value is scaled according to the following equation: absolute_threshold = luma_minimum_value + pixel_black_th * luma_range_size luma_range_size and luma_minimum_value depend on the input video format, the range is [0-255] for YUV full-range formats and [16-235] for YUV non full-range formats. Default value is 0.10.

        The following example sets the maximum pixel threshold to the minimum value,
        and detects only black intervals of 2 or more seconds:



            blackdetect=d=2:pix_th=0.00




        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param float d: Set the minimum detected black duration expressed in seconds. It must be a non-negative floating point number. Default value is 2.0.

        ### 11.14 blackframe

        Detect frames that are (almost) completely black. Can be useful to detect

        of the detected frame, the percentage of blackness, the position in the file
        if known or -1 and the timestamp in seconds.

        In order to display the output lines, you need to set the loglevel at least to

        ### 11.15 blend

        Blend two video frames into each other.

        The `blend` filter takes two input streams and outputs one stream, the first
        input is the "top" layer and second input is "bottom" layer. By default, the
        output terminates when the longest input terminates.

        The `tblend` (time blend) filter takes two consecutive frames from one single
        stream, and outputs the result obtained by blending the new frame on top of
        the old frame.

        A description of the accepted options follows.

        **c0_mode**

        **c1_mode**

        **c2_mode**

        **c3_mode**

        **all_mode**

            Set blend mode for specific pixel component or all pixel components in case of all_mode. Default value is normal. Available values for component modes are: ‘addition’ ‘and’ ‘average’ ‘bleach’ ‘burn’ ‘darken’ ‘difference’ ‘divide’ ‘dodge’ ‘exclusion’ ‘extremity’ ‘freeze’ ‘geometric’ ‘glow’ ‘grainextract’ ‘grainmerge’ ‘hardlight’ ‘hardmix’ ‘hardoverlay’ ‘harmonic’ ‘heat’ ‘interpolate’ ‘lighten’ ‘linearlight’ ‘multiply’ ‘multiply128’ ‘negation’ ‘normal’ ‘or’ ‘overlay’ ‘phoenix’ ‘pinlight’ ‘reflect’ ‘screen’ ‘softdifference’ ‘softlight’ ‘stain’ ‘subtract’ ‘vividlight’ ‘xor’

        **c0_opacity**

        **c1_opacity**

        **c2_opacity**

        **c3_opacity**

        **all_opacity**

            Set blend opacity for specific pixel component or all pixel components in case of all_opacity. Only used in combination with pixel component blend modes.

        **c0_expr**

        **c1_expr**

        **c2_expr**

        **c3_expr**

        **all_expr**

            Set blend expression for specific pixel component or all pixel components in case of all_expr. Note that related mode options will be ignored if those are set. The expressions can use the following variables: N The sequential number of the filtered frame, starting from 0. X Y the coordinates of the current sample W H the width and height of currently filtered plane SW SH Width and height scale for the plane being filtered. It is the ratio between the dimensions of the current plane to the luma plane, e.g. for a yuv420p frame, the values are 1,1 for the luma plane and 0.5,0.5 for the chroma planes. T Time of the current frame, expressed in seconds. TOP, A Value of pixel component at current location for first video frame (top layer). BOTTOM, B Value of pixel component at current location for second video frame (bottom layer).

        The `blend` filter also supports the framesync options.

        ### 11.17 blurdetect

        Determines blurriness of frames without altering the input frames.

        Based on Marziliano, Pina, et al. "A no-reference perceptual blur metric."
        Allows for a block-based abbreviation.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **low**

        **high**

            Set low and high threshold values used by the Canny thresholding algorithm. The high threshold selects the "strong" edge pixels, which are then connected through 8-connectivity with the "weak" edge pixels selected by the low threshold. low and high threshold values must be chosen in the range [0,1], and low should be lesser or equal to high. Default value for low is 20/255, and default value for high is 50/255.

        **radius**

            Define the radius to search around an edge pixel for local maxima.

        **block_pct**

            Determine blurriness only for the most significant blocks, given in percentage.

        **block_width**

            Determine blurriness for blocks of width block_width. If set to any value smaller 1, no blocks are used and the whole image is processed as one no matter of block_height.

        **block_height**

            Determine blurriness for blocks of height block_height. If set to any value smaller 1, no blocks are used and the whole image is processed as one no matter of block_width.

        **planes**

            Set planes to filter. Default is first only.

        ### 11.31 colorbalance

        Modify intensity of primary colors (red, green and blue) of input frames.

        The filter allows an input frame to be adjusted in the shadows, midtones or
        highlights regions for the red-cyan, green-magenta or blue-yellow balance.

        A positive adjustment value shifts the balance towards the primary color, a
        negative value towards the complementary color.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **rs**

        **gs**

        **bs**

            Adjust red, green and blue shadows (darkest pixels).

        ### 11.36 colorkey

        RGB colorspace color keying. This filter operates on 8-bit RGB format frames
        by setting the alpha component of each pixel which falls within the similarity
        radius of the key color to 0. The alpha value for pixels outside the
        similarity radius depends on the value of the blend option.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **color**

            Set the color for which alpha will be set to 0 (full transparency). See (ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. Default is black.

        **similarity**

            Set the radius from the key color within which other colors also have full transparency. The computed distance is related to the unit fractional distance in 3D space between the RGB values of the key color and the pixel’s color. Range is 0.01 to 1.0. 0.01 matches within a very small radius around the exact key color, while 1.0 matches everything. Default is 0.01.

        **blend**

            Set how the alpha value for pixels that fall outside the similarity radius is computed. 0.0 makes pixels either fully transparent or fully opaque. Higher values result in semi-transparent pixels, with greater transparency the more similar the pixel color is to the key color. Range is 0.0 to 1.0. Default is 0.0.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param str color: Set the color for which alpha will be set to 0 (full transparency). See (ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. Default is black.
        :param float similarity: Set the radius from the key color within which other colors also have full transparency. The computed distance is related to the unit fractional distance in 3D space between the RGB values of the key color and the pixel’s color. Range is 0.01 to 1.0. 0.01 matches within a very small radius around the exact key color, while 1.0 matches everything. Default is 0.01.
        :param float blend: Set how the alpha value for pixels that fall outside the similarity radius is computed. 0.0 makes pixels either fully transparent or fully opaque. Higher values result in semi-transparent pixels, with greater transparency the more similar the pixel color is to the key color. Range is 0.0 to 1.0. Default is 0.0.

        ### 11.39 colormap

        Apply custom color maps to video stream.

        This filter needs three input video streams. First stream is video stream that
        is going to be filtered out. Second and third video stream specify color
        patches for source color to target color mapping.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **patch_size**

            Set the source and target video stream patch size in pixels.

        **nb_patches**

            Set the max number of used patches from source and target video stream. Default value is number of patches available in additional video streams. Max allowed number of patches is 64.

        **type**

            Set the adjustments used for target colors. Can be relative or absolute. Defaults is absolute.

        **kernel**

            Set the kernel used to measure color differences between mapped colors. The accepted values are: ‘euclidean’ ‘weuclidean’ Default is euclidean.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param str patch_size: Set the source and target video stream patch size in pixels.
        :param int nb_patches: Set the max number of used patches from source and target video stream. Default value is number of patches available in additional video streams. Max allowed number of patches is 64.

        ### 11.47 coreimage

        Video filtering on GPU using Apple’s CoreImage API on OSX.

        Hardware acceleration is based on an OpenGL context. Usually, this means it is
        processed by video hardware. However, software-based OpenGL implementations
        exist which means there is no guarantee for hardware processing. It depends on
        the respective OSX.

        There are many filters and image generators provided by Apple that come with a
        large variety of options. The filter has to be referenced by its name along
        with its options.

        The coreimage filter accepts the following options:

        **list_filters**

            List all available filters and generators along with all their respective options as well as possible minimum and maximum values along with the default values. list_filters=true

        **filter**

            Specify all filters by their respective name and options. Use list_filters to determine all valid filter names and options. Numerical options are specified by a float value and are automatically clamped to their respective value range. Vector and color options have to be specified by a list of space separated float values. Character escaping has to be done. A special option name default is available to use default options for a filter. It is required to specify either default or at least one of the filter options. All omitted options are used with their default values. The syntax of the filter string is as follows: filter=<NAME>@<OPTION>=<VALUE>[@<OPTION>=<VALUE>][@...][#<NAME>@<OPTION>=<VALUE>[@<OPTION>=<VALUE>][@...]][#...]

        **output_rect**

            Specify a rectangle where the output of the filter chain is copied into the input image. It is given by a list of space separated float values: output_rect=x\ y\ width\ height If not given, the output rectangle equals the dimensions of the input image. The output rectangle is automatically cropped at the borders of the input image. Negative values are valid for each component. output_rect=25\ 25\ 100\ 100

        Several filters can be chained for successive processing without GPU-HOST
        transfers allowing for fast processing of complex filter chains. Currently,
        only filters with zero (generators) or exactly one (filters) input image and
        one output image are supported. Also, transition filters are not yet usable as
        intended.

        Some filters generate output images with additional padding depending on the
        respective filter kernel. The padding is automatically removed to ensure the
        filter output has the same size as the input image.

        For image generators, the size of the output image is determined by the
        previous output image of the filter chain or the input image of the whole
        filterchain, respectively. The generators do not use the pixel information of
        this image to generate their output. However, the generated output is blended
        onto this image, resulting in partial or complete coverage of the output
        image.

        The coreimagesrc video source can be used for generating input images which
        are directly fed into the filter chain. By using it, providing input images by
        another video source or an input video is not required.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param bool list_filters: List all available filters and generators along with all their respective options as well as possible minimum and maximum values along with the default values. list_filters=true
        :param bool list_generators: None
        :param str filter: Specify all filters by their respective name and options. Use list_filters to determine all valid filter names and options. Numerical options are specified by a float value and are automatically clamped to their respective value range. Vector and color options have to be specified by a list of space separated float values. Character escaping has to be done. A special option name default is available to use default options for a filter. It is required to specify either default or at least one of the filter options. All omitted options are used with their default values. The syntax of the filter string is as follows: filter=<NAME>@<OPTION>=<VALUE>[@<OPTION>=<VALUE>][@...][#<NAME>@<OPTION>=<VALUE>[@<OPTION>=<VALUE>][@...]][#...]

        ### 11.48 corr

        Obtain the correlation between two input videos.

        This filter takes two input videos.

        Both input videos must have the same resolution and pixel format for this
        filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs have the same
        number of frames, which are compared one by one.

        The obtained per component, average, min and max correlation is printed
        through the logging system.

        The filter stores the calculated correlation of each frame in frame metadata.

        This filter also supports the framesync options.

        In the below example the input file main.mpg being processed is compared with
        the reference file ref.mpg.

        ### 11.50 crop

        Crop the input video to given dimensions.

        It accepts the following parameters:

        **w, out_w**

            The width of the output video. It defaults to iw. This expression is evaluated only once during the filter configuration, or when the ‘w’ or ‘out_w’ command is sent.

        **h, out_h**

            The height of the output video. It defaults to ih. This expression is evaluated only once during the filter configuration, or when the ‘h’ or ‘out_h’ command is sent.

        **x**

            The horizontal position, in the input video, of the left edge of the output video. It defaults to (in_w-out_w)/2. This expression is evaluated per-frame.

        **y**

            The vertical position, in the input video, of the top edge of the output video. It defaults to (in_h-out_h)/2. This expression is evaluated per-frame.

        **keep_aspect**

            If set to 1 will force the output display aspect ratio to be the same of the input, by changing the output sample aspect ratio. It defaults to 0.

        **exact**

            Enable exact cropping. If enabled, subsampled videos will be cropped at exact width/height/x/y as specified and will not be rounded to nearest smaller value. It defaults to 0.

        The out_w, out_h, x, y parameters are expressions containing the following
        constants:

        **x**

        **y**

            The computed values for x and y. They are evaluated for each new frame.

        **in_w**

        **in_h**

            The input width and height.

        **iw**

        **ih**

            These are the same as in_w and in_h.

        **out_w**

        **out_h**

            The output (cropped) width and height.

        **ow**

        **oh**

            These are the same as out_w and out_h.

        **a**

            same as iw / ih

        **sar**

            input sample aspect ratio

        **dar**

            input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (iw / ih) * sar

        **hsub**

        **vsub**

            horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the pixel format "yuv422p" hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.

        **n**

            The number of the input frame, starting from 0.

        **pos**

            the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if unknown; deprecated, do not use

        **t**

            The timestamp expressed in seconds. It’s NAN if the input timestamp is unknown.

        The expression for out_w may depend on the value of out_h, and the expression
        for out_h may depend on out_w, but they cannot depend on x and y, as x and y
        are evaluated after out_w and out_h.

        The x and y parameters specify the expressions for the position of the top-
        left corner of the output (non-cropped) area. They are evaluated for each
        frame. If the evaluated value is not valid, it is approximated to the nearest
        valid value.

        The expression for x may depend on y, and the expression for y may depend on
        x.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param str out_w: The width of the output video. It defaults to iw. This expression is evaluated only once during the filter configuration, or when the ‘w’ or ‘out_w’ command is sent.

        ### 11.51 cropdetect

        Auto-detect the crop size.

        It calculates the necessary cropping parameters and prints the recommended
        parameters via the logging system. The detected dimensions correspond to the
        non-black or video area of the input video according to mode.

        It accepts the following parameters:

        **mode**

            Depending on mode crop detection is based on either the mere black value of surrounding pixels or a combination of motion vectors and edge pixels. ‘black’ Detect black pixels surrounding the playing video. For fine control use option limit. ‘mvedges’ Detect the playing video by the motion vectors inside the video and scanning for edge pixels typically forming the border of a playing video.

        **limit**

            Set higher black value threshold, which can be optionally specified from nothing (0) to everything (255 for 8-bit based formats). An intensity value greater to the set value is considered non-black. It defaults to 24. You can also specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0 which will be scaled depending on the bitdepth of the pixel format.

        **round**

            The value which the width/height should be divisible by. It defaults to 16\. The offset is automatically adjusted to center the video. Use 2 to get only even dimensions (needed for 4:2:2 video). 16 is best when encoding to most video codecs.

        **skip**

            Set the number of initial frames for which evaluation is skipped. Default is 2. Range is 0 to INT_MAX.

        **reset_count, reset**

            Set the counter that determines after how many frames cropdetect will reset the previously detected largest video area and start over to detect the current optimal crop area. Default value is 0. This can be useful when channel logos distort the video area. 0 indicates ’never reset’, and returns the largest area encountered during playback.

        **mv_threshold**

            Set motion in pixel units as threshold for motion detection. It defaults to 8.

        **low**

        **high**

            Set low and high threshold values used by the Canny thresholding algorithm. The high threshold selects the "strong" edge pixels, which are then connected through 8-connectivity with the "weak" edge pixels selected by the low threshold. low and high threshold values must be chosen in the range [0,1], and low should be lesser or equal to high. Default value for low is 5/255, and default value for high is 15/255.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param float limit: Set higher black value threshold, which can be optionally specified from nothing (0) to everything (255 for 8-bit based formats).

        ### 11.52 cue

        Delay video filtering until a given wallclock timestamp. The filter first
        passes on preroll amount of frames, then it buffers at most buffer amount of
        frames and waits for the cue. After reaching the cue it forwards the buffered
        frames and also any subsequent frames coming in its input.

        The filter can be used synchronize the output of multiple ffmpeg processes for
        realtime output devices like decklink. By putting the delay in the filtering
        chain and pre-buffering frames the process can pass on data to output almost
        immediately after the target wallclock timestamp is reached.

        ### 11.53 curves

        Apply color adjustments using curves.

        This filter is similar to the Adobe Photoshop and GIMP curves tools. Each
        component (red, green and blue) has its values defined by N key points tied
        from each other using a smooth curve. The x-axis represents the pixel values
        from the input frame, and the y-axis the new pixel values to be set for the
        output frame.

        By default, a component curve is defined by the two points (0;0) and (1;1).
        This creates a straight line where each original pixel value is "adjusted" to
        its own value, which means no change to the image.

        The filter allows you to redefine these two points and add some more. A new
        curve will be define to pass smoothly through all these new coordinates. The
        new defined points needs to be strictly increasing over the x-axis, and their
        x and y values must be in the [0;1] interval. The curve is formed by using a
        natural or monotonic cubic spline interpolation, depending on the interp
        option (default: `natural`). The `natural` spline produces a smoother curve in
        general while the monotonic (`pchip`) spline guarantees the transitions
        between the specified points to be monotonic. If the computed curves happened
        to go outside the vector spaces, the values will be clipped accordingly.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **preset**

            Select one of the available color presets. This option can be used in addition to the r, g, b parameters; in this case, the later options takes priority on the preset values. Available presets are: ‘none’ ‘color_negative’ ‘cross_process’ ‘darker’ ‘increase_contrast’ ‘lighter’ ‘linear_contrast’ ‘medium_contrast’ ‘negative’ ‘strong_contrast’ ‘vintage’ Default is none.

        **master, m**

            Set the master key points. These points will define a second pass mapping. It is sometimes called a "luminance" or "value" mapping. It can be used with r, g, b or all since it acts like a post-processing LUT.

        **red, r**

            Set the key points for the red component.

        **green, g**

            Set the key points for the green component.

        **blue, b**

            Set the key points for the blue component.

        **all**

            Set the key points for all components (not including master). Can be used in addition to the other key points component options. In this case, the unset component(s) will fallback on this all setting.

        **psfile**

            Specify a Photoshop curves file (.acv) to import the settings from.

        **plot**

            Save Gnuplot script of the curves in specified file.

        **interp**

            Specify the kind of interpolation. Available algorithms are: ‘natural’ Natural cubic spline using a piece-wise cubic polynomial that is twice continuously differentiable. ‘pchip’ Monotonic cubic spline using a piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial (PCHIP).

        To avoid some filtergraph syntax conflicts, each key points list need to be
        defined using the following syntax: `x0/y0 x1/y1 x2/y2 ...`.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param int preset: Select one of the available color presets. This option can be used in addition to the r, g, b parameters; in this case, the later options takes priority on the preset values. Available presets are: ‘none’ ‘color_negative’ ‘cross_process’ ‘darker’ ‘increase_contrast’ ‘lighter’ ‘linear_contrast’ ‘medium_contrast’ ‘negative’ ‘strong_contrast’ ‘vintage’ Default is none.
        :param str master: Set the master key points. These points will define a second pass mapping. It is sometimes called a "luminance" or "value" mapping. It can be used with r, g, b or all since it acts like a post-processing LUT.
        :param str red: Set the key points for the red component.
        :param str green: Set the key points for the green component.
        :param str blue: Set the key points for the blue component.
        :param str all: Set the key points for all components (not including master). Can be used in addition to the other key points component options. In this case, the unset component(s) will fallback on this all setting.
        :param str psfile: Specify a Photoshop curves file (.acv) to import the settings from.
        :param str plot: Save Gnuplot script of the curves in specified file.
        :param int interp: Specify the kind of interpolation. Available algorithms are: ‘natural’ Natural cubic spline using a piece-wise cubic polynomial that is twice continuously differentiable. ‘pchip’ Monotonic cubic spline using a piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial (PCHIP).

        ### 11.56 dctdnoiz

        Denoise frames using 2D DCT (frequency domain filtering).

        This filter is not designed for real time.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **sigma, s**

            Set the noise sigma constant. This sigma defines a hard threshold of 3 * sigma; every DCT coefficient (absolute value) below this threshold with be dropped. If you need a more advanced filtering, see expr. Default is 0.

        **overlap**

            Set number overlapping pixels for each block. Since the filter can be slow, you may want to reduce this value, at the cost of a less effective filter and the risk of various artefacts. If the overlapping value doesn’t permit processing the whole input width or height, a warning will be displayed and according borders won’t be denoised. Default value is blocksize-1, which is the best possible setting.

        **expr, e**

            Set the coefficient factor expression. For each coefficient of a DCT block, this expression will be evaluated as a multiplier value for the coefficient. If this is option is set, the sigma option will be ignored. The absolute value of the coefficient can be accessed through the c variable.

        **n**

            Set the blocksize using the number of bits. 1<<n defines the blocksize, which is the width and height of the processed blocks. The default value is 3 (8x8) and can be raised to 4 for a blocksize of 16x16. Note that changing this setting has huge consequences on the speed processing. Also, a larger block size does not necessarily means a better de-noising.

        ### 11.57 deband

        Remove banding artifacts from input video. It works by replacing banded pixels
        with average value of referenced pixels.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **1thr**

        **2thr**

        **3thr**

        **4thr**

            Set banding detection threshold for each plane. Default is 0.02. Valid range is 0.00003 to 0.5. If difference between current pixel and reference pixel is less than threshold, it will be considered as banded.

        **range, r**

            Banding detection range in pixels. Default is 16. If positive, random number in range 0 to set value will be used. If negative, exact absolute value will be used. The range defines square of four pixels around current pixel.

        **direction, d**

            Set direction in radians from which four pixel will be compared. If positive, random direction from 0 to set direction will be picked. If negative, exact of absolute value will be picked. For example direction 0, -PI or -2*PI radians will pick only pixels on same row and -PI/2 will pick only pixels on same column.

        **blur, b**

            If enabled, current pixel is compared with average value of all four surrounding pixels. The default is enabled. If disabled current pixel is compared with all four surrounding pixels. The pixel is considered banded if only all four differences with surrounding pixels are less than threshold.

        **coupling, c**

            If enabled, current pixel is changed if and only if all pixel components are banded, e.g. banding detection threshold is triggered for all color components. The default is disabled.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param float _1thr: Set banding detection threshold for each plane. Default is 0.02. Valid range is 0.00003 to 0.5. If difference between current pixel and reference pixel is less than threshold, it will be considered as banded.

        source was partially telecined content then the output of `pullup,dejudder`
        will have a variable frame rate. May change the recorded frame rate of the
        container. Aside from that change, this filter will not affect constant frame
        rate video.

        **cycle**

            Specify the length of the window over which the judder repeats. Accepts any integer greater than 1. Useful values are: ‘4’ If the original was telecined from 24 to 30 fps (Film to NTSC). ‘5’ If the original was telecined from 25 to 30 fps (PAL to NTSC). ‘20’ If a mixture of the two.

        sometimes something even uglier appear - your mileage may vary).

        It accepts the following parameters:

        **x**

        **y**

            Specify the top left corner coordinates of the logo. They must be specified.

        **w**

        **h**

            Specify the width and height of the logo to clear. They must be specified.

        **show**

            When set to 1, a green rectangle is drawn on the screen to simplify finding the right x, y, w, and h parameters. The default value is 0. The rectangle is drawn on the outermost pixels which will be (partly) replaced with interpolated values. The values of the next pixels immediately outside this rectangle in each direction will be used to compute the interpolated pixel values inside the rectangle.

        ### 11.67 deshake

        Attempt to fix small changes in horizontal and/or vertical shift. This filter
        helps remove camera shake from hand-holding a camera, bumping a tripod, moving
        on a vehicle, etc.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **x**

        **y**

        **w**

        **h**

            Specify a rectangular area where to limit the search for motion vectors. If desired the search for motion vectors can be limited to a rectangular area of the frame defined by its top left corner, width and height. These parameters have the same meaning as the drawbox filter which can be used to visualise the position of the bounding box. This is useful when simultaneous movement of subjects within the frame might be confused for camera motion by the motion vector search. If any or all of x, y, w and h are set to -1 then the full frame is used. This allows later options to be set without specifying the bounding box for the motion vector search. Default - search the whole frame.

        **rx**

        **ry**

            Specify the maximum extent of movement in x and y directions in the range 0-64 pixels. Default 16.

        **edge**

            Specify how to generate pixels to fill blanks at the edge of the frame. Available values are: ‘blank, 0’ Fill zeroes at blank locations ‘original, 1’ Original image at blank locations ‘clamp, 2’ Extruded edge value at blank locations ‘mirror, 3’ Mirrored edge at blank locations Default value is ‘mirror’.

        **blocksize**

            Specify the blocksize to use for motion search. Range 4-128 pixels, default 8.

        **contrast**

            Specify the contrast threshold for blocks. Only blocks with more than the specified contrast (difference between darkest and lightest pixels) will be considered. Range 1-255, default 125.

        **search**

            Specify the search strategy. Available values are: ‘exhaustive, 0’ Set exhaustive search ‘less, 1’ Set less exhaustive search. Default value is ‘exhaustive’.

        **filename**

            If set then a detailed log of the motion search is written to the specified file.

        ### 12.6 deshake_opencl

        Feature-point based video stabilization filter.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **tripod**

            Simulates a tripod by preventing any camera movement whatsoever from the original frame. Defaults to 0.

        **debug**

            Whether or not additional debug info should be displayed, both in the processed output and in the console. Note that in order to see console debug output you will also need to pass -v verbose to ffmpeg. Viewing point matches in the output video is only supported for RGB input. Defaults to 0.

        **adaptive_crop**

            Whether or not to do a tiny bit of cropping at the borders to cut down on the amount of mirrored pixels. Defaults to 1.

        **refine_features**

            Whether or not feature points should be refined at a sub-pixel level. This can be turned off for a slight performance gain at the cost of precision. Defaults to 1.

        **smooth_strength**

            The strength of the smoothing applied to the camera path from 0.0 to 1.0. 1.0 is the maximum smoothing strength while values less than that result in less smoothing. 0.0 causes the filter to adaptively choose a smoothing strength on a per-frame basis. Defaults to 0.0.

        **smooth_window_multiplier**

            Controls the size of the smoothing window (the number of frames buffered to determine motion information from). The size of the smoothing window is determined by multiplying the framerate of the video by this number. Acceptable values range from 0.1 to 10.0. Larger values increase the amount of motion data available for determining how to smooth the camera path, potentially improving smoothness, but also increase latency and memory usage. Defaults to 2.0.

        ### 11.71 displace

        Displace pixels as indicated by second and third input stream.

        It takes three input streams and outputs one stream, the first input is the
        source, and second and third input are displacement maps.

        The second input specifies how much to displace pixels along the x-axis, while
        the third input specifies how much to displace pixels along the y-axis. If one
        of displacement map streams terminates, last frame from that displacement map
        will be used.

        Note that once generated, displacements maps can be reused over and over
        again.

        A description of the accepted options follows.

        **edge**

            Set displace behavior for pixels that are out of range. Available values are: ‘blank’ Missing pixels are replaced by black pixels. ‘smear’ Adjacent pixels will spread out to replace missing pixels. ‘wrap’ Out of range pixels are wrapped so they point to pixels of other side. ‘mirror’ Out of range pixels will be replaced with mirrored pixels.

        ### 11.75 drawbox

        Draw a colored box on the input image.

        It accepts the following parameters:

        **x**

        **y**

            The expressions which specify the top left corner coordinates of the box. It defaults to 0.

        **width, w**

        **height, h**

            The expressions which specify the width and height of the box; if 0 they are interpreted as the input width and height. It defaults to 0.

        **color, c**

            Specify the color of the box to write. For the general syntax of this option, check the (ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. If the special value invert is used, the box edge color is the same as the video with inverted luma.

        **thickness, t**

            The expression which sets the thickness of the box edge. A value of fill will create a filled box. Default value is 3. See below for the list of accepted constants.

        **replace**

            Applicable if the input has alpha. With value 1, the pixels of the painted box will overwrite the video’s color and alpha pixels. Default is 0, which composites the box onto the input, leaving the video’s alpha intact.

        The parameters for x, y, w and h and t are expressions containing the
        following constants:

        **dar**

            The input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (w / h) * sar.

        **hsub**

        **vsub**

            horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the pixel format "yuv422p" hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.

        **in_h, ih**

        **in_w, iw**

            The input width and height.

        **sar**

            The input sample aspect ratio.

        **x**

        **y**

            The x and y offset coordinates where the box is drawn.

        **w**

        **h**

            The width and height of the drawn box.

        **box_source**

            Box source can be set as side_data_detection_bboxes if you want to use box data in detection bboxes of side data. If box_source is set, the x, y, width and height will be ignored and still use box data in detection bboxes of side data. So please do not use this parameter if you were not sure about the box source.

        **t**

            The thickness of the drawn box. These constants allow the x, y, w, h and t expressions to refer to each other, so you may for example specify y=x/dar or h=w/dar.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param str x: The expressions which specify the top left corner coordinates of the box. It defaults to 0.
        :param str y: The expressions which specify the top left corner coordinates of the box. It defaults to 0.

        ### 11.77 drawgrid

        Draw a grid on the input image.

        It accepts the following parameters:

        **x**

        **y**

            The expressions which specify the coordinates of some point of grid intersection (meant to configure offset). Both default to 0.

        **width, w**

        **height, h**

            The expressions which specify the width and height of the grid cell, if 0 they are interpreted as the input width and height, respectively, minus thickness, so image gets framed. Default to 0.

        **color, c**

            Specify the color of the grid. For the general syntax of this option, check the (ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. If the special value invert is used, the grid color is the same as the video with inverted luma.

        **thickness, t**

            The expression which sets the thickness of the grid line. Default value is 1. See below for the list of accepted constants.

        **replace**

            Applicable if the input has alpha. With 1 the pixels of the painted grid will overwrite the video’s color and alpha pixels. Default is 0, which composites the grid onto the input, leaving the video’s alpha intact.

        The parameters for x, y, w and h and t are expressions containing the
        following constants:

        **dar**

            The input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (w / h) * sar.

        **hsub**

        **vsub**

            horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the pixel format "yuv422p" hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.

        **in_h, ih**

        **in_w, iw**

            The input grid cell width and height.

        **sar**

            The input sample aspect ratio.

        **x**

        **y**

            The x and y coordinates of some point of grid intersection (meant to configure offset).

        **w**

        **h**

            The width and height of the drawn cell.

        **t**

            The thickness of the drawn cell. These constants allow the x, y, w, h and t expressions to refer to each other, so you may for example specify y=x/dar or h=w/dar.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param str x: The expressions which specify the coordinates of some point of grid intersection (meant to configure offset). Both default to 0.

        ### 11.79 edgedetect

        Detect and draw edges. The filter uses the Canny Edge Detection algorithm.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **low**

        **high**

            Set low and high threshold values used by the Canny thresholding algorithm. The high threshold selects the "strong" edge pixels, which are then connected through 8-connectivity with the "weak" edge pixels selected by the low threshold. low and high threshold values must be chosen in the range [0,1], and low should be lesser or equal to high. Default value for low is 20/255, and default value for high is 50/255.

        **mode**

            Define the drawing mode. ‘wires’ Draw white/gray wires on black background. ‘colormix’ Mix the colors to create a paint/cartoon effect. ‘canny’ Apply Canny edge detector on all selected planes. Default value is wires.

        **planes**

            Select planes for filtering. By default all available planes are filtered.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param float high: Set low and high threshold values used by the Canny thresholding algorithm. The high threshold selects the "strong" edge pixels, which are then connected through 8-connectivity with the "weak" edge pixels selected by the low threshold. low and high threshold values must be chosen in the range [0,1], and low should be lesser or equal to high.

        ### 11.80 elbg

        Apply a posterize effect using the ELBG (Enhanced LBG) algorithm.

        For each input image, the filter will compute the optimal mapping from the
        input to the output given the codebook length, that is the number of distinct
        output colors.

        This filter accepts the following options.

        **codebook_length, l**

            Set codebook length. The value must be a positive integer, and represents the number of distinct output colors. Default value is 256.

        **nb_steps, n**

            Set the maximum number of iterations to apply for computing the optimal mapping. The higher the value the better the result and the higher the computation time. Default value is 1.

        **seed, s**

            Set a random seed, must be an integer included between 0 and UINT32_MAX. If not specified, or if explicitly set to -1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best effort basis.

        **pal8**

            Set pal8 output pixel format. This option does not work with codebook length greater than 256. Default is disabled.

        **use_alpha**

            Include alpha values in the quantization calculation. Allows creating palettized output images (e.g. PNG8) with multiple alpha smooth blending.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param int codebook_length: Set codebook length. The value must be a positive integer, and represents the number of distinct output colors. Default value is 256.

        ### 11.88 fade

        Apply a fade-in/out effect to the input video.

        It accepts the following parameters:

        **type, t**

            The effect type can be either "in" for a fade-in, or "out" for a fade-out effect. Default is in.

        **start_frame, s**

            Specify the number of the frame to start applying the fade effect at. Default is 0.

        **nb_frames, n**

            The number of frames that the fade effect lasts. At the end of the fade-in effect, the output video will have the same intensity as the input video. At the end of the fade-out transition, the output video will be filled with the selected color. Default is 25.

        **alpha**

            If set to 1, fade only alpha channel, if one exists on the input. Default value is 0.

        **start_time, st**

            Specify the timestamp (in seconds) of the frame to start to apply the fade effect. If both start_frame and start_time are specified, the fade will start at whichever comes last. Default is 0.

        **duration, d**

            The number of seconds for which the fade effect has to last. At the end of the fade-in effect the output video will have the same intensity as the input video, at the end of the fade-out transition the output video will be filled with the selected color. If both duration and nb_frames are specified, duration is used. Default is 0 (nb_frames is used by default).

        **color, c**

            Specify the color of the fade. Default is "black".

        ### 11.95 fieldorder

        Transform the field order of the input video.

        It accepts the following parameters:

        **order**

            The output field order. Valid values are tff for top field first or bff for bottom field first.

        The default value is ‘tff’.

        The transformation is done by shifting the picture content up or down by one
        line, and filling the remaining line with appropriate picture content. This
        method is consistent with most broadcast field order converters.

        If the input video is not flagged as being interlaced, or it is already
        flagged as being of the required output field order, then this filter does not
        alter the incoming video.

        It is very useful when converting to or from PAL DV material, which is bottom
        field first.

        For example:



            ffmpeg -i in.vob -vf "fieldorder=bff" out.dv




        Parameters:
        ----------

        ### 11.98 find_rect

        Find a rectangular object in the input video.

        The object to search for must be specified as a gray8 image specified with the
        object option.

        For each possible match, a score is computed. If the score reaches the
        specified threshold, the object is considered found.

        If the input video contains multiple instances of the object, the filter will
        find only one of them.

        When an object is found, the following metadata entries are set in the
        matching frame:

        **lavfi.rect.w**

            width of object

        **lavfi.rect.h**

            height of object

        **lavfi.rect.x**

            x position of object

        **lavfi.rect.y**

            y position of object

        **lavfi.rect.score**

            match score of the found object

        It accepts the following options:

        **object**

            Filepath of the object image, needs to be in gray8.

        **threshold**

            Detection threshold, expressed as a decimal number in the range 0-1. A threshold value of 0.01 means only exact matches, a threshold of 0.99 means almost everything matches. Default value is 0.5.

        **mipmaps**

            Number of mipmaps, default is 3.

        **xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax**

            Specifies the rectangle in which to search.

        **discard**

            Discard frames where object is not detected. Default is disabled.

        **start_time**

            Assume the first PTS should be the given value, in seconds. This allows for padding/trimming at the start of stream. By default, no assumption is made about the first frame’s expected PTS, so no padding or trimming is done. For example, this could be set to 0 to pad the beginning with duplicates of the first frame if a video stream starts after the audio stream or to trim any frames with a negative PTS.

        **round**

            Timestamp (PTS) rounding method. Possible values are: zero round towards 0 inf round away from 0 down round towards -infinity up round towards +infinity near round to nearest The default is near.

        **eof_action**

            Action performed when reading the last frame. Possible values are: round Use same timestamp rounding method as used for other frames. pass Pass through last frame if input duration has not been reached yet. The default is round.

        Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string:
        fps[:start_time[:round]].

            Specify the output frames per second. This option can also be specified as a value alone. The default is 50.

        **interp_start**

            Specify the start of a range where the output frame will be created as a linear interpolation of two frames. The range is [0-255], the default is 15.

        **interp_end**

            Specify the end of a range where the output frame will be created as a linear interpolation of two frames. The range is [0-255], the default is 240.

        **scene**

            Specify the level at which a scene change is detected as a value between 0 and 100 to indicate a new scene; a low value reflects a low probability for the current frame to introduce a new scene, while a higher value means the current frame is more likely to be one. The default is 8.2.

        **flags**

            Specify flags influencing the filter process. Available value for flags is: scene_change_detect, scd Enable scene change detection using the value of the option scene. This flag is enabled by default.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param str fps: Specify the output frames per second. This option can also be specified as a value alone. The default is 50.
        :param int interp_start: Specify the start of a range where the output frame will be created as a linear interpolation of two frames. The range is [0-255], the default is 15.

        ### 11.105 freezedetect

        Detect frozen video.

        This filter logs a message and sets frame metadata when it detects that the
        input video has no significant change in content during a specified duration.
        Video freeze detection calculates the mean average absolute difference of all
        the components of video frames and compares it to a noise floor.

        The printed times and duration are expressed in seconds. The
        `lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_start` metadata key is set on the first frame whose
        timestamp equals or exceeds the detection duration and it contains the
        timestamp of the first frame of the freeze. The
        `lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_duration` and `lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_end`
        metadata keys are set on the first frame after the freeze.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **noise, n**

            Set noise tolerance. Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the specified value) or as a difference ratio between 0 and 1. Default is -60dB, or 0.001.

        **duration, d**

            Set freeze duration until notification (default is 2 seconds).

        ### 11.107 frei0r

        Apply a frei0r effect to the input video.

        To enable the compilation of this filter, you need to install the frei0r
        header and configure FFmpeg with `--enable-frei0r`.

        It accepts the following parameters:

        **filter_name**

            The name of the frei0r effect to load. If the environment variable FREI0R_PATH is defined, the frei0r effect is searched for in each of the directories specified by the colon-separated list in FREI0R_PATH. Otherwise, the standard frei0r paths are searched, in this order: HOME/.frei0r-1/lib/, /usr/local/lib/frei0r-1/, /usr/lib/frei0r-1/.

        **filter_params**

            A ’|’-separated list of parameters to pass to the frei0r effect.

        A frei0r effect parameter can be a boolean (its value is either "y" or "n"), a
        double, a color (specified as R/G/B, where R, G, and B are floating point
        numbers between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive) or a color description as specified in
        the [(ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual](ffmpeg-
        utils.html#color-syntax), a position (specified as X/Y, where X and Y are
        floating point numbers) and/or a string.

        The number and types of parameters depend on the loaded effect. If an effect
        parameter is not specified, the default value is set.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param str filter_name: The name of the frei0r effect to load. If the environment variable FREI0R_PATH is defined, the frei0r effect is searched for in each of the directories specified by the colon-separated list in FREI0R_PATH.

        ### 11.108 fspp

        Apply fast and simple postprocessing. It is a faster version of spp.

        It splits (I)DCT into horizontal/vertical passes. Unlike the simple post-
        processing filter, one of them is performed once per block, not per pixel.
        This allows for much higher speed.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **quality**

            Set quality. This option defines the number of levels for averaging. It accepts an integer in the range 4-5. Default value is 4.

        **qp**

            Force a constant quantization parameter. It accepts an integer in range 0-63. If not set, the filter will use the QP from the video stream (if available).

        **strength**

            Set filter strength. It accepts an integer in range -15 to 32. Lower values mean more details but also more artifacts, while higher values make the image smoother but also blurrier. Default value is 0 − PSNR optimal.

        **use_bframe_qp**

            Enable the use of the QP from the B-Frames if set to 1. Using this option may cause flicker since the B-Frames have often larger QP. Default is 0 (not enabled).

            Set the luma expression.

        **cb_expr, cb**

            Set the chrominance blue expression.

        **cr_expr, cr**

            Set the green expression.

        **blue_expr, b**

            Set the blue expression.

        The colorspace is selected according to the specified options. If one of the
        lum_expr, cb_expr, or cr_expr options is specified, the filter will
        automatically select a YCbCr colorspace. If one of the red_expr, green_expr,
        or blue_expr options is specified, it will select an RGB colorspace.

        If one of the chrominance expression is not defined, it falls back on the
        other one. If no alpha expression is specified it will evaluate to opaque
        value. If none of chrominance expressions are specified, they will evaluate to
        the luma expression.

        The expressions can use the following variables and functions:

        **N**

            The sequential number of the filtered frame, starting from 0.

        **X**

        **Y**

            The coordinates of the current sample.

        **W**

        **H**

            The width and height of the image.

        **SW**

        **SH**

            Width and height scale depending on the currently filtered plane. It is the ratio between the corresponding luma plane number of pixels and the current plane ones. E.g. for YUV4:2:0 the values are 1,1 for the luma plane, and 0.5,0.5 for chroma planes.

        **T**

            Time of the current frame, expressed in seconds.

        **p(x, y)**

            Return the value of the pixel at location (x,y) of the current plane.

        **lum(x, y)**

            Return the value of the pixel at location (x,y) of the luma plane.

        **cb(x, y)**

            Return the value of the pixel at location (x,y) of the blue-difference chroma plane. Return 0 if there is no such plane.

        **cr(x, y)**

            Return the value of the pixel at location (x,y) of the red-difference chroma plane. Return 0 if there is no such plane.

        **r(x, y)**

        **g(x, y)**

        **b(x, y)**

            Return the value of the pixel at location (x,y) of the red/green/blue component. Return 0 if there is no such component.

        **alpha(x, y)**

            Return the value of the pixel at location (x,y) of the alpha plane. Return 0 if there is no such plane.

        **psum(x,y), lumsum(x, y), cbsum(x,y), crsum(x,y), rsum(x,y), gsum(x,y),
        bsum(x,y), alphasum(x,y)**

            Sum of sample values in the rectangle from (0,0) to (x,y), this allows obtaining sums of samples within a rectangle. See the functions without the sum postfix.

        **interpolation**

            Set one of interpolation methods: nearest, n bilinear, b Default is bilinear.

        For functions, if x and y are outside the area, the value will be
        automatically clipped to the closer edge.

        Please note that this filter can use multiple threads in which case each slice
        will have its own expression state. If you want to use only a single
        expression state because your expressions depend on previous state then you
        should limit the number of filter threads to 1.

        ### 11.111 gradfun

        Fix the banding artifacts that are sometimes introduced into nearly flat
        regions by truncation to 8-bit color depth. Interpolate the gradients that
        should go where the bands are, and dither them.

        It is designed for playback only. Do not use it prior to lossy compression,
        because compression tends to lose the dither and bring back the bands.

        It accepts the following parameters:

        **strength**

            The maximum amount by which the filter will change any one pixel. This is also the threshold for detecting nearly flat regions. Acceptable values range from .51 to 64; the default value is 1.2. Out-of-range values will be clipped to the valid range.

        **radius**

            The neighborhood to fit the gradient to. A larger radius makes for smoother gradients, but also prevents the filter from modifying the pixels near detailed regions. Acceptable values are 8-32; the default value is 16. Out-of-range values will be clipped to the valid range.

        Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string:
        strength[:radius]

        Apply a Hald CLUT to a video stream.

        First input is the video stream to process, and second one is the Hald CLUT.
        The Hald CLUT input can be a simple picture or a complete video stream.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **clut**

            Set which CLUT video frames will be processed from second input stream, can be first or all. Default is all.

        **shortest**

            Force termination when the shortest input terminates. Default is 0.

        **repeatlast**

            Continue applying the last CLUT after the end of the stream. A value of 0 disable the filter after the last frame of the CLUT is reached. Default is 1.

        `haldclut` also has the same interpolation options as lut3d (both filters
        share the same internals).

        This filter also supports the framesync options.

        ### 11.118 histeq

        This filter applies a global color histogram equalization on a per-frame
        basis.

        It can be used to correct video that has a compressed range of pixel
        intensities. The filter redistributes the pixel intensities to equalize their
        distribution across the intensity range. It may be viewed as an "automatically
        adjusting contrast filter". This filter is useful only for correcting degraded
        or poorly captured source video.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **strength**

            Determine the amount of equalization to be applied. As the strength is reduced, the distribution of pixel intensities more-and-more approaches that of the input frame. The value must be a float number in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.200.

        **intensity**

            Set the maximum intensity that can generated and scale the output values appropriately. The strength should be set as desired and then the intensity can be limited if needed to avoid washing-out. The value must be a float number in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.210.

        **antibanding**

            Set the antibanding level. If enabled the filter will randomly vary the luminance of output pixels by a small amount to avoid banding of the histogram. Possible values are none, weak or strong. It defaults to none.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param float strength: Determine the amount of equalization to be applied. As the strength is reduced, the distribution of pixel intensities more-and-more approaches that of the input frame. The value must be a float number in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.200.

        ### 11.119 histogram

        Compute and draw a color distribution histogram for the input video.

        The computed histogram is a representation of the color component distribution
        in an image.

        Standard histogram displays the color components distribution in an image.
        Displays color graph for each color component. Shows distribution of the Y, U,
        V, A or R, G, B components, depending on input format, in the current frame.
        Below each graph a color component scale meter is shown.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **level_height**

            Set height of level. Default value is 200. Allowed range is [50, 2048].

        **scale_height**

            Set height of color scale. Default value is 12. Allowed range is [0, 40].

        **display_mode**

            Set display mode. It accepts the following values: ‘stack’ Per color component graphs are placed below each other. ‘parade’ Per color component graphs are placed side by side. ‘overlay’ Presents information identical to that in the parade, except that the graphs representing color components are superimposed directly over one another. Default is stack.

        **levels_mode**

            Set mode. Can be either linear, or logarithmic. Default is linear.

        **components**

            Set what color components to display. Default is 7.

        **fgopacity**

            Set foreground opacity. Default is 0.7.

        **bgopacity**

            Set background opacity. Default is 0.5.

        **colors_mode**

            Set colors mode. It accepts the following values: ‘whiteonblack’ ‘blackonwhite’ ‘whiteongray’ ‘blackongray’ ‘coloronblack’ ‘coloronwhite’ ‘colorongray’ ‘blackoncolor’ ‘whiteoncolor’ ‘grayoncolor’ Default is whiteonblack.

        ### 11.122 hwmap

        Map hardware frames to system memory or to another device.

        This filter has several different modes of operation; which one is used
        depends on the input and output formats:

          * Hardware frame input, normal frame output

        Map the input frames to system memory and pass them to the output. If the
        original hardware frame is later required (for example, after overlaying
        something else on part of it), the hwmap filter can be used again in the next
        mode to retrieve it.

          * Normal frame input, hardware frame output

        If the input is actually a software-mapped hardware frame, then unmap it -
        that is, return the original hardware frame.

        Otherwise, a device must be provided. Create new hardware surfaces on that
        device for the output, then map them back to the software format at the input
        and give those frames to the preceding filter. This will then act like the
        hwupload filter, but may be able to avoid an additional copy when the input is
        already in a compatible format.

          * Hardware frame input and output

        A device must be supplied for the output, either directly or with the
        derive_device option. The input and output devices must be of different types
        and compatible - the exact meaning of this is system-dependent, but typically
        it means that they must refer to the same underlying hardware context (for
        example, refer to the same graphics card).

        If the input frames were originally created on the output device, then unmap
        to retrieve the original frames.

        Otherwise, map the frames to the output device - create new hardware frames on
        the output corresponding to the frames on the input.

        The following additional parameters are accepted:

        **mode**

            Set the frame mapping mode. Some combination of: read The mapped frame should be readable. write The mapped frame should be writeable. overwrite The mapping will always overwrite the entire frame. This may improve performance in some cases, as the original contents of the frame need not be loaded. direct The mapping must not involve any copying. Indirect mappings to copies of frames are created in some cases where either direct mapping is not possible or it would have unexpected properties. Setting this flag ensures that the mapping is direct and will fail if that is not possible. Defaults to read+write if not specified.

        **derive_device type**

            Rather than using the device supplied at initialisation, instead derive a new device of type type from the device the input frames exist on.

        **reverse**

            In a hardware to hardware mapping, map in reverse - create frames in the sink and map them back to the source. This may be necessary in some cases where a mapping in one direction is required but only the opposite direction is supported by the devices being used. This option is dangerous - it may break the preceding filter in undefined ways if there are any additional constraints on that filter’s output. Do not use it without fully understanding the implications of its use.

        :param str mode: Set the frame mapping mode.

        **multiple.undetermined**

            Cumulative number of frames that could not be classified using multiple-frame detection.

        **repeated.current_frame**

            Which field in the current frame is repeated from the last. One of “neither”, “top”, or “bottom”.

        **repeated.neither**

            Cumulative number of frames with no repeated field.

        **repeated.top**

            Cumulative number of frames with the top field repeated from the previous frame’s top field.

        **repeated.bottom**

            Cumulative number of frames with the bottom field repeated from the previous frame’s bottom field.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **intl_thres**

            Set interlacing threshold.

        **prog_thres**

            Set progressive threshold.

        **rep_thres**

            Threshold for repeated field detection.

        **half_life**

            Number of frames after which a given frame’s contribution to the statistics is halved (i.e., it contributes only 0.5 to its classification). The default of 0 means that all frames seen are given full weight of 1.0 forever.

        **analyze_interlaced_flag**

            When this is not 0 then idet will use the specified number of frames to determine if the interlaced flag is accurate, it will not count undetermined frames. If the flag is found to be accurate it will be used without any further computations, if it is found to be inaccurate it will be cleared without any further computations. This allows inserting the idet filter as a low computational method to clean up the interlaced flag

        ### 11.136 il

        Deinterleave or interleave fields.

        This filter allows one to process interlaced images fields without
        deinterlacing them. Deinterleaving splits the input frame into 2 fields (so
        called half pictures). Odd lines are moved to the top half of the output
        image, even lines to the bottom half. You can process (filter) them
        independently and then re-interleave them.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **luma_mode, l**

        **chroma_mode, c**

        **alpha_mode, a**

            Available values for luma_mode, chroma_mode and alpha_mode are: ‘none’ Do nothing. ‘deinterleave, d’ Deinterleave fields, placing one above the other. ‘interleave, i’ Interleave fields. Reverse the effect of deinterleaving. Default value is none.

        **luma_swap, ls**

        **chroma_swap, cs**

        **alpha_swap, as**

            Swap luma/chroma/alpha fields. Exchange even & odd lines. Default value is 0.

        ### 11.142 lenscorrection

        Correct radial lens distortion

        This filter can be used to correct for radial distortion as can result from
        the use of wide angle lenses, and thereby re-rectify the image. To find the
        right parameters one can use tools available for example as part of opencv or
        simply trial-and-error. To use opencv use the calibration sample (under
        samples/cpp) from the opencv sources and extract the k1 and k2 coefficients
        from the resulting matrix.

        Note that effectively the same filter is available in the open-source tools
        Krita and Digikam from the KDE project.

        In contrast to the vignette filter, which can also be used to compensate lens
        errors, this filter corrects the distortion of the image, whereas vignette
        corrects the brightness distribution, so you may want to use both filters
        together in certain cases, though you will have to take care of ordering, i.e.
        whether vignetting should be applied before or after lens correction.

        ### 11.143 lensfun

        Apply lens correction via the lensfun library
        (<http://lensfun.sourceforge.net/>).

        The `lensfun` filter requires the camera make, camera model, and lens model to
        apply the lens correction. The filter will load the lensfun database and query
        it to find the corresponding camera and lens entries in the database. As long
        as these entries can be found with the given options, the filter can perform
        corrections on frames. Note that incomplete strings will result in the filter
        choosing the best match with the given options, and the filter will output the
        chosen camera and lens models (logged with level "info"). You must provide the
        make, camera model, and lens model as they are required.

        To obtain a list of available makes and models, leave out one or both of
        `make` and `model` options. The filter will send the full list to the log with
        level `INFO`. The first column is the make and the second column is the model.
        To obtain a list of available lenses, set any values for make and model and
        leave out the `lens_model` option. The filter will send the full list of
        lenses in the log with level `INFO`. The ffmpeg tool will exit after the list
        is printed.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **make**

            The make of the camera (for example, "Canon"). This option is required.

        **model**

            The model of the camera (for example, "Canon EOS 100D"). This option is required.

        **lens_model**

            The model of the lens (for example, "Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM"). This option is required.

        **db_path**

            The full path to the lens database folder. If not set, the filter will attempt to load the database from the install path when the library was built. Default is unset.

        **mode**

            The type of correction to apply. The following values are valid options: ‘vignetting’ Enables fixing lens vignetting. ‘geometry’ Enables fixing lens geometry. This is the default. ‘subpixel’ Enables fixing chromatic aberrations. ‘vig_geo’ Enables fixing lens vignetting and lens geometry. ‘vig_subpixel’ Enables fixing lens vignetting and chromatic aberrations. ‘distortion’ Enables fixing both lens geometry and chromatic aberrations. ‘all’ Enables all possible corrections.

        **focal_length**

            The focal length of the image/video (zoom; expected constant for video). For example, a 18–55mm lens has focal length range of [18–55], so a value in that range should be chosen when using that lens. Default 18.

        **aperture**

            The aperture of the image/video (expected constant for video). Note that aperture is only used for vignetting correction. Default 3.5.

        **focus_distance**

            The focus distance of the image/video (expected constant for video). Note that focus distance is only used for vignetting and only slightly affects the vignetting correction process. If unknown, leave it at the default value (which is 1000).

        **scale**

            The scale factor which is applied after transformation. After correction the video is no longer necessarily rectangular. This parameter controls how much of the resulting image is visible. The value 0 means that a value will be chosen automatically such that there is little or no unmapped area in the output image. 1.0 means that no additional scaling is done. Lower values may result in more of the corrected image being visible, while higher values may avoid unmapped areas in the output.

        **target_geometry**

            The target geometry of the output image/video. The following values are valid options: ‘rectilinear (default)’ ‘fisheye’ ‘panoramic’ ‘equirectangular’ ‘fisheye_orthographic’ ‘fisheye_stereographic’ ‘fisheye_equisolid’ ‘fisheye_thoby’

        **reverse**

            Apply the reverse of image correction (instead of correcting distortion, apply it).

        **interpolation**

            The type of interpolation used when correcting distortion. The following values are valid options: ‘nearest’ ‘linear (default)’ ‘lanczos’

Can be one of following: ‘same_str’ Values are interpreted as strings, returns true if metadata value is same as value. ‘starts_with’ Values are interpreted as strings, returns true if metadata value starts with the value option string. ‘less’ Values are interpreted as floats, returns true if metadata value is less than value. ‘equal’ Values are interpreted as floats, returns true if value is equal with metadata value. ‘greater’ Values are interpreted as floats, returns true if metadata value is greater than value. ‘expr’ Values are interpreted as floats, returns true if expression from option expr evaluates to true. ‘ends_with’ Values are interpreted as strings, returns true if metadata value ends with the value option string.

        **expr**

            Set expression which is used when function is set to expr. The expression is evaluated through the eval API and can contain the following constants: VALUE1, FRAMEVAL Float representation of value from metadata key. VALUE2, USERVAL Float representation of value as supplied by user in value option.

        **file**

            If specified in print mode, output is written to the named file. Instead of plain filename any writable url can be specified. Filename “-” is a shorthand for standard output. If file option is not set, output is written to the log with AV_LOG_INFO loglevel.

        **direct**

            Reduces buffering in print mode when output is written to a URL set using file.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param int mode: Set mode of operation of the filter. Can be one of the following: ‘select’ If both value and key is set, select frames which have such metadata. If only key is set, select every frame that has such key in metadata. ‘add’ Add new metadata key and value. If key is already available do nothing. ‘modify’ Modify value of already present key. ‘delete’ If value is set, delete only keys that have such value. Otherwise, delete key. If key is not set, delete all metadata values in the frame. ‘print’ Print key and its value if metadata was found. If key is not set print all metadata values available in frame.
        :param str key: Set key used with all modes. Must be set for all modes except print and delete.
        :param str value: Set metadata value which will be used. This option is mandatory for modify and add mode.

        Apply Midway Image Equalization effect using two video streams.

        Midway Image Equalization adjusts a pair of images to have the same histogram,
        while maintaining their dynamics as much as possible. It’s useful for e.g.
        matching exposures from a pair of stereo cameras.

        This filter has two inputs and one output, which must be of same pixel format,

Following values are accepted: ‘obmc’ Overlapped block motion compensation. ‘aobmc’ Adaptive overlapped block motion compensation. Window weighting coefficients are controlled adaptively according to the reliabilities of the neighboring motion vectors to reduce oversmoothing. Default mode is ‘obmc’. ‘me_mode’ Motion estimation mode. Following values are accepted: ‘bidir’ Bidirectional motion estimation. Motion vectors are estimated for each source frame in both forward and backward directions. ‘bilat’ Bilateral motion estimation. Motion vectors are estimated directly for interpolated frame. Default mode is ‘bilat’. ‘me’ The algorithm to be used for motion estimation. Following values are accepted: ‘esa’ Exhaustive search algorithm. ‘tss’ Three step search algorithm. ‘tdls’ Two dimensional logarithmic search algorithm. ‘ntss’ New three step search algorithm. ‘fss’ Four step search algorithm. ‘ds’ Diamond search algorithm. ‘hexbs’ Hexagon-based search algorithm. ‘epzs’ Enhanced predictive zonal search algorithm. ‘umh’ Uneven multi-hexagon search algorithm.

        ### 11.170 mpdecimate

        Drop frames that do not differ greatly from the previous frame in order to
        reduce frame rate.

        The main use of this filter is for very-low-bitrate encoding (e.g. streaming
        over dialup modem), but it could in theory be used for fixing movies that were
        inverse-telecined incorrectly.

        A description of the accepted options follows.

        **max**

            Set the maximum number of consecutive frames which can be dropped (if positive), or the minimum interval between dropped frames (if negative). If the value is 0, the frame is dropped disregarding the number of previous sequentially dropped frames. Default value is 0.

        **keep**

            Set the maximum number of consecutive similar frames to ignore before to start dropping them. If the value is 0, the frame is dropped disregarding the number of previous sequentially similar frames. Default value is 0.

        **hi**

        **lo**

        **frac**

            Set the dropping threshold values. Values for hi and lo are for 8x8 pixel blocks and represent actual pixel value differences, so a threshold of 64 corresponds to 1 unit of difference for each pixel, or the same spread out differently over the block. A frame is a candidate for dropping if no 8x8 blocks differ by more than a threshold of hi, and if no more than frac blocks (1 meaning the whole image) differ by more than a threshold of lo. Default value for hi is 64*12, default value for lo is 64*5, and default value for frac is 0.33.

        ### 11.171 msad

        Obtain the MSAD (Mean Sum of Absolute Differences) between two input videos.

        This filter takes two input videos.

        Both input videos must have the same resolution and pixel format for this
        filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs have the same
        number of frames, which are compared one by one.

        The obtained per component, average, min and max MSAD is printed through the
        logging system.

        The filter stores the calculated MSAD of each frame in frame metadata.

        This filter also supports the framesync options.

        In the below example the input file main.mpg being processed is compared with
        the reference file ref.mpg.

        ### 11.174 nlmeans

        Denoise frames using Non-Local Means algorithm.

        Each pixel is adjusted by looking for other pixels with similar contexts. This
        context similarity is defined by comparing their surrounding patches of size
        pxp. Patches are searched in an area of rxr around the pixel.

        Note that the research area defines centers for patches, which means some
        patches will be made of pixels outside that research area.

        The filter accepts the following options.

        **s**

            Set denoising strength. Default is 1.0. Must be in range [1.0, 30.0].

        **p**

            Set patch size. Default is 7. Must be odd number in range [0, 99].

        **pc**

            Same as p but for chroma planes. The default value is 0 and means automatic.

        **r**

            Set research size. Default is 15. Must be odd number in range [0, 99].

        **rc**

            Mandatory option, without binary file filter can not work. Currently file can be found here: https://github.com/dubhater/vapoursynth-nnedi3/blob/master/src/nnedi3_weights.bin

        **deint**

            Set which frames to deinterlace, by default it is all. Can be all or interlaced.

        **field**

            Set mode of operation. Can be one of the following: ‘af’ Use frame flags, both fields. ‘a’ Use frame flags, single field. ‘t’ Use top field only. ‘b’ Use bottom field only. ‘tf’ Use both fields, top first. ‘bf’ Use both fields, bottom first.

        **planes**

            Set which planes to process, by default filter process all frames.

        **nsize**

            Set size of local neighborhood around each pixel, used by the predictor neural network. Can be one of the following: ‘s8x6’ ‘s16x6’ ‘s32x6’ ‘s48x6’ ‘s8x4’ ‘s16x4’ ‘s32x4’

        **nns**

            Set the number of neurons in predictor neural network. Can be one of the following: ‘n16’ ‘n32’ ‘n64’ ‘n128’ ‘n256’

        **qual**

            Controls the number of different neural network predictions that are blended together to compute the final output value. Can be fast, default or slow.

        **etype**

            Set which set of weights to use in the predictor. Can be one of the following: ‘a, abs’ weights trained to minimize absolute error ‘s, mse’ weights trained to minimize squared error

        **pscrn**

            Controls whether or not the prescreener neural network is used to decide which pixels should be processed by the predictor neural network and which can be handled by simple cubic interpolation. The prescreener is trained to know whether cubic interpolation will be sufficient for a pixel or whether it should be predicted by the predictor nn. The computational complexity of the prescreener nn is much less than that of the predictor nn. Since most pixels can be handled by cubic interpolation, using the prescreener generally results in much faster processing. The prescreener is pretty accurate, so the difference between using it and not using it is almost always unnoticeable. Can be one of the following: ‘none’ ‘original’ ‘new’ ‘new2’ ‘new3’ Default is new.

        ### 11.178 normalize

        Normalize RGB video (aka histogram stretching, contrast stretching). See:
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(image_processing)

        For each channel of each frame, the filter computes the input range and maps
        it linearly to the user-specified output range. The output range defaults to
        the full dynamic range from pure black to pure white.

        Temporal smoothing can be used on the input range to reduce flickering (rapid
        changes in brightness) caused when small dark or bright objects enter or leave
        the scene. This is similar to the auto-exposure (automatic gain control) on a
        video camera, and, like a video camera, it may cause a period of over- or
        under-exposure of the video.

        The R,G,B channels can be normalized independently, which may cause some color
        shifting, or linked together as a single channel, which prevents color
        shifting. Linked normalization preserves hue. Independent normalization does
        not, so it can be used to remove some color casts. Independent and linked
        normalization can be combined in any ratio.

        The normalize filter accepts the following options:

        **blackpt**

        **whitept**

            Colors which define the output range. The minimum input value is mapped to the blackpt. The maximum input value is mapped to the whitept. The defaults are black and white respectively. Specifying white for blackpt and black for whitept will give color-inverted, normalized video. Shades of grey can be used to reduce the dynamic range (contrast). Specifying saturated colors here can create some interesting effects.

        **smoothing**

            The number of previous frames to use for temporal smoothing. The input range of each channel is smoothed using a rolling average over the current frame and the smoothing previous frames. The default is 0 (no temporal smoothing).

        **independence**

            Controls the ratio of independent (color shifting) channel normalization to linked (color preserving) normalization. 0.0 is fully linked, 1.0 is fully independent. Defaults to 1.0 (fully independent).

        **strength**

            Overall strength of the filter. 1.0 is full strength. 0.0 is a rather expensive no-op. Defaults to 1.0 (full strength).



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param str blackpt: Colors which define the output range. The minimum input value is mapped to the blackpt. The maximum input value is mapped to the whitept. The defaults are black and white respectively. Specifying white for blackpt and black for whitept will give color-inverted, normalized video.

        ### 11.183 overlay

        Overlay one video on top of another.

        It takes two inputs and has one output. The first input is the "main" video on
        which the second input is overlaid.

        It accepts the following parameters:

        A description of the accepted options follows.

        **x**

        **y**

            Set the expression for the x and y coordinates of the overlaid video on the main video. Default value is "0" for both expressions. In case the expression is invalid, it is set to a huge value (meaning that the overlay will not be displayed within the output visible area).

        **eof_action**

            See framesync.

        **eval**

            Set when the expressions for x, and y are evaluated. It accepts the following values: ‘init’ only evaluate expressions once during the filter initialization or when a command is processed ‘frame’ evaluate expressions for each incoming frame Default value is ‘frame’.

        **shortest**

            See framesync.

        **format**

            Set the format for the output video. It accepts the following values: ‘yuv420’ force YUV 4:2:0 8-bit planar output ‘yuv420p10’ force YUV 4:2:0 10-bit planar output ‘yuv422’ force YUV 4:2:2 8-bit planar output ‘yuv422p10’ force YUV 4:2:2 10-bit planar output ‘yuv444’ force YUV 4:4:4 8-bit planar output ‘yuv444p10’ force YUV 4:4:4 10-bit planar output ‘rgb’ force RGB 8-bit packed output ‘gbrp’ force RGB 8-bit planar output ‘auto’ automatically pick format Default value is ‘yuv420’.

        **repeatlast**

            See framesync.

        **alpha**

            Set format of alpha of the overlaid video, it can be straight or premultiplied. Default is straight.

        The x, and y expressions can contain the following parameters.

        **main_w, W**

        **main_h, H**

            The main input width and height.

        **overlay_w, w**

        **overlay_h, h**

            The overlay input width and height.

        **x**

        **y**

            The computed values for x and y. They are evaluated for each new frame.

        **hsub**

        **vsub**

            horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values of the output format. For example for the pixel format "yuv422p" hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.

        **n**

            the number of input frame, starting from 0

        **pos**

            the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if unknown; deprecated, do not use

        **t**

            The timestamp, expressed in seconds. It’s NAN if the input timestamp is unknown.

        This filter also supports the framesync options.

        Note that the n, t variables are available only when evaluation is done _per
        frame_ , and will evaluate to NAN when eval is set to ‘init’.

        Be aware that frames are taken from each input video in timestamp order,
        hence, if their initial timestamps differ, it is a good idea to pass the two
        inputs through a setpts=PTS-STARTPTS filter to have them begin in the same
        zero timestamp, as the example for the movie filter does.

        You can chain together more overlays but you should test the efficiency of
        such approach.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param str x: Set the expression for the x and y coordinates of the overlaid video on the main video. Default value is "0" for both expressions. In case the expression is invalid, it is set to a huge value (meaning that the overlay will not be displayed within the output visible area).

        **width, w**

        **height, h**

            Specify an expression for the size of the output image with the paddings added. If the value for width or height is 0, the corresponding input size is used for the output. The width expression can reference the value set by the height expression, and vice versa. The default value of width and height is 0.

        **x**

        **y**

            Specify the offsets to place the input image at within the padded area, with respect to the top/left border of the output image. The x expression can reference the value set by the y expression, and vice versa. The default value of x and y is 0. If x or y evaluate to a negative number, they’ll be changed so the input image is centered on the padded area.

        **color**

            Specify the color of the padded area. For the syntax of this option, check the (ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. The default value of color is "black".

        **eval**

            Specify when to evaluate width, height, x and y expression. It accepts the following values: ‘init’ Only evaluate expressions once during the filter initialization or when a command is processed. ‘frame’ Evaluate expressions for each incoming frame. Default value is ‘init’.

        **aspect**

            Pad to aspect instead to a resolution.

        The value for the width, height, x, and y options are expressions containing
        the following constants:

        **in_w**

        **in_h**

        ### 11.187 palettegen

        Generate one palette for a whole video stream.

        It accepts the following options:

        **max_colors**

            Set the maximum number of colors to quantize in the palette. Note: the palette will still contain 256 colors; the unused palette entries will be black.

        **reserve_transparent**

            Create a palette of 255 colors maximum and reserve the last one for transparency. Reserving the transparency color is useful for GIF optimization. If not set, the maximum of colors in the palette will be 256. You probably want to disable this option for a standalone image. Set by default.

        **transparency_color**

            Set the color that will be used as background for transparency.

        **stats_mode**

            Set statistics mode. It accepts the following values: ‘full’ Compute full frame histograms. ‘diff’ Compute histograms only for the part that differs from previous frame. This might be relevant to give more importance to the moving part of your input if the background is static. ‘single’ Compute new histogram for each frame. Default value is full.

        The filter also exports the frame metadata `lavfi.color_quant_ratio`
        (`nb_color_in / nb_color_out`) which you can use to evaluate the degree of
        color quantization of the palette. This information is also visible at info
        logging level.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param int max_colors: Set the maximum number of colors to quantize in the palette. Note: the palette will still contain 256 colors; the unused palette entries will be black.

        ### 11.188 paletteuse

        Use a palette to downsample an input video stream.

        The filter takes two inputs: one video stream and a palette. The palette must
        be a 256 pixels image.

        It accepts the following options:

        **dither**

            Select dithering mode. Available algorithms are: ‘bayer’ Ordered 8x8 bayer dithering (deterministic) ‘heckbert’ Dithering as defined by Paul Heckbert in 1982 (simple error diffusion). Note: this dithering is sometimes considered "wrong" and is included as a reference. ‘floyd_steinberg’ Floyd and Steingberg dithering (error diffusion) ‘sierra2’ Frankie Sierra dithering v2 (error diffusion) ‘sierra2_4a’ Frankie Sierra dithering v2 "Lite" (error diffusion) ‘sierra3’ Frankie Sierra dithering v3 (error diffusion) ‘burkes’ Burkes dithering (error diffusion) ‘atkinson’ Atkinson dithering by Bill Atkinson at Apple Computer (error diffusion) ‘none’ Disable dithering. Default is sierra2_4a.

        **bayer_scale**

            When bayer dithering is selected, this option defines the scale of the pattern (how much the crosshatch pattern is visible). A low value means more visible pattern for less banding, and higher value means less visible pattern at the cost of more banding. The option must be an integer value in the range [0,5]. Default is 2.

        **diff_mode**

            If set, define the zone to process ‘rectangle’ Only the changing rectangle will be reprocessed. This is similar to GIF cropping/offsetting compression mechanism. This option can be useful for speed if only a part of the image is changing, and has use cases such as limiting the scope of the error diffusal dither to the rectangle that bounds the moving scene (it leads to more deterministic output if the scene doesn’t change much, and as a result less moving noise and better GIF compression). Default is none.

        **new**

            Take new palette for each output frame.

        **alpha_threshold**

            Sets the alpha threshold for transparency. Alpha values above this threshold will be treated as completely opaque, and values below this threshold will be treated as completely transparent. The option must be an integer value in the range [0,255]. Default is 128.

        ### 18.14 perms, aperms

        Set read/write permissions for the output frames.

        These filters are mainly aimed at developers to test direct path in the
        following filter in the filtergraph.

        The filters accept the following options:

        **mode**

            Select the permissions mode. It accepts the following values: ‘none’ Do nothing. This is the default. ‘ro’ Set all the output frames read-only. ‘rw’ Set all the output frames directly writable. ‘toggle’ Make the frame read-only if writable, and writable if read-only. ‘random’ Set each output frame read-only or writable randomly.

        **seed**

            Set the seed for the random mode, must be an integer included between 0 and UINT32_MAX. If not specified, or if explicitly set to -1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best effort basis.

        Note: in case of auto-inserted filter between the permission filter and the
        following one, the permission might not be received as expected in that
        following filter. Inserting a format or aformat filter before the perms/aperms
        filter can avoid this problem.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param int mode: Select the permissions mode. It accepts the following values: ‘none’ Do nothing. This is the default. ‘ro’ Set all the output frames read-only. ‘rw’ Set all the output frames directly writable. ‘toggle’ Make the frame read-only if writable, and writable if read-only. ‘random’ Set each output frame read-only or writable randomly.
        :param int seed: Set the seed for the random mode, must be an integer included between 0 and UINT32_MAX. If not specified, or if explicitly set to -1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best effort basis.

        ### 11.190 phase

        Delay interlaced video by one field time so that the field order changes.

        The intended use is to fix PAL movies that have been captured with the
        opposite field order to the film-to-video transfer.

        A description of the accepted parameters follows.

        **mode**

            Set phase mode. It accepts the following values: ‘t’ Capture field order top-first, transfer bottom-first. Filter will delay the bottom field. ‘b’ Capture field order bottom-first, transfer top-first. Filter will delay the top field. ‘p’ Capture and transfer with the same field order. This mode only exists for the documentation of the other options to refer to, but if you actually select it, the filter will faithfully do nothing. ‘a’ Capture field order determined automatically by field flags, transfer opposite. Filter selects among ‘t’ and ‘b’ modes on a frame by frame basis using field flags. If no field information is available, then this works just like ‘u’. ‘u’ Capture unknown or varying, transfer opposite. Filter selects among ‘t’ and ‘b’ on a frame by frame basis by analyzing the images and selecting the alternative that produces best match between the fields. ‘T’ Capture top-first, transfer unknown or varying. Filter selects among ‘t’ and ‘p’ using image analysis. ‘B’ Capture bottom-first, transfer unknown or varying. Filter selects among ‘b’ and ‘p’ using image analysis. ‘A’ Capture determined by field flags, transfer unknown or varying. Filter selects among ‘t’, ‘b’ and ‘p’ using field flags and image analysis. If no field information is available, then this works just like ‘U’. This is the default mode. ‘U’ Both capture and transfer unknown or varying. Filter selects among ‘t’, ‘b’ and ‘p’ using image analysis only.

        Enable the specified chain of postprocessing subfilters using libpostproc.
        This library should be automatically selected with a GPL build (`--enable-
        gpl`). Subfilters must be separated by ’/’ and can be disabled by prepending a
        ’-’. Each subfilter and some options have a short and a long name that can be
        used interchangeably, i.e. dr/dering are the same.

        The filters accept the following options:

        **subfilters**

            Set postprocessing subfilters string.

        All subfilters share common options to determine their scope:

        **a/autoq**

            Honor the quality commands for this subfilter.

        **c/chrom**

            Do chrominance filtering, too (default).

        **y/nochrom**

            Do luma filtering only (no chrominance).

        **n/noluma**

            Do chrominance filtering only (no luma).

        These options can be appended after the subfilter name, separated by a ’|’.

        Available subfilters are:

        **hb/hdeblock[|difference[|flatness]]**

            Horizontal deblocking filter difference Difference factor where higher values mean more deblocking (default: 32). flatness Flatness threshold where lower values mean more deblocking (default: 39).

        **vb/vdeblock[|difference[|flatness]]**

            Vertical deblocking filter difference Difference factor where higher values mean more deblocking (default: 32). flatness Flatness threshold where lower values mean more deblocking (default: 39).

        **ha/hadeblock[|difference[|flatness]]**

            Accurate horizontal deblocking filter difference Difference factor where higher values mean more deblocking (default: 32). flatness Flatness threshold where lower values mean more deblocking (default: 39).

        **va/vadeblock[|difference[|flatness]]**

            Accurate vertical deblocking filter difference Difference factor where higher values mean more deblocking (default: 32). flatness Flatness threshold where lower values mean more deblocking (default: 39).

        The horizontal and vertical deblocking filters share the difference and
        flatness values so you cannot set different horizontal and vertical
        thresholds.

        **h1/x1hdeblock**

            Experimental horizontal deblocking filter

        **v1/x1vdeblock**

        **al/autolevels[:f/fullyrange], automatic brightness / contrast correction**

             f/fullyrange Stretch luma to 0-255.

        **lb/linblenddeint**

        ### 11.200 psnr

        Obtain the average, maximum and minimum PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio)
        between two input videos.

        This filter takes in input two input videos, the first input is considered the
        "main" source and is passed unchanged to the output. The second input is used
        as a "reference" video for computing the PSNR.

        Both video inputs must have the same resolution and pixel format for this
        filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs have the same
        number of frames, which are compared one by one.

        The obtained average PSNR is printed through the logging system.

        The filter stores the accumulated MSE (mean squared error) of each frame, and
        at the end of the processing it is averaged across all frames equally, and the
        following formula is applied to obtain the PSNR:



            PSNR = 10*log10(MAX^2/MSE)


        Where MAX is the average of the maximum values of each component of the image.

        The description of the accepted parameters follows.

        **stats_file, f**

            If specified the filter will use the named file to save the PSNR of each individual frame. When filename equals "-" the data is sent to standard output.

        **stats_version**

            Specifies which version of the stats file format to use. Details of each format are written below. Default value is 1.

        **stats_add_max**

            Determines whether the max value is output to the stats log. Default value is 0. Requires stats_version >= 2. If this is set and stats_version < 2, the filter will return an error.

        This filter also supports the framesync options.

        The file printed if stats_file is selected, contains a sequence of key/value
        pairs of the form key:value for each compared couple of frames.

        If a stats_version greater than 1 is specified, a header line precedes the
        list of per-frame-pair stats, with key value pairs following the frame format
        with the following parameters:

        **psnr_log_version**

            The version of the log file format. Will match stats_version.

        **fields**

            A comma separated list of the per-frame-pair parameters included in the log.

        A description of each shown per-frame-pair parameter follows:

        **n**

            sequential number of the input frame, starting from 1

        **mse_avg**

            Mean Square Error pixel-by-pixel average difference of the compared frames, averaged over all the image components.

        **mse_y, mse_u, mse_v, mse_r, mse_g, mse_b, mse_a**

            Mean Square Error pixel-by-pixel average difference of the compared frames for the component specified by the suffix.

        **psnr_y, psnr_u, psnr_v, psnr_r, psnr_g, psnr_b, psnr_a**

            Peak Signal to Noise ratio of the compared frames for the component specified by the suffix.

        **max_avg, max_y, max_u, max_v**

            Maximum allowed value for each channel, and average over all channels.

        ### 11.201 pullup

        Pulldown reversal (inverse telecine) filter, capable of handling mixed hard-
        telecine, 24000/1001 fps progressive, and 30000/1001 fps progressive content.

        The pullup filter is designed to take advantage of future context in making
        its decisions. This filter is stateless in the sense that it does not lock
        onto a pattern to follow, but it instead looks forward to the following fields
        in order to identify matches and rebuild progressive frames.

        To produce content with an even framerate, insert the fps filter after pullup,
        use `fps=24000/1001` if the input frame rate is 29.97fps, `fps=24` for 30fps
        and the (rare) telecined 25fps input.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **jl**

        **jr**

        **jt**

        **jb**

            These options set the amount of "junk" to ignore at the left, right, top, and bottom of the image, respectively. Left and right are in units of 8 pixels, while top and bottom are in units of 2 lines. The default is 8 pixels on each side.

        **sb**

            Set the strict breaks. Setting this option to 1 will reduce the chances of filter generating an occasional mismatched frame, but it may also cause an excessive number of frames to be dropped during high motion sequences. Conversely, setting it to -1 will make filter match fields more easily. This may help processing of video where there is slight blurring between the fields, but may also cause there to be interlaced frames in the output. Default value is 0.

        **mp**

            Set the metric plane to use. It accepts the following values: ‘l’ Use luma plane. ‘u’ Use chroma blue plane. ‘v’ Use chroma red plane. This option may be set to use chroma plane instead of the default luma plane for doing filter’s computations. This may improve accuracy on very clean source material, but more likely will decrease accuracy, especially if there is chroma noise (rainbow effect) or any grayscale video. The main purpose of setting mp to a chroma plane is to reduce CPU load and make pullup usable in realtime on slow machines.

        For best results (without duplicated frames in the output file) it is
        necessary to change the output frame rate. For example, to inverse telecine
        NTSC input:



            ffmpeg -i input -vf pullup -r 24000/1001 ...




        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param int jl: These options set the amount of "junk" to ignore at the left, right, top, and bottom of the image, respectively. Left and right are in units of 8 pixels, while top and bottom are in units of 2 lines. The default is 8 pixels on each side.
        :param int jr: These options set the amount of "junk" to ignore at the left, right, top, and bottom of the image, respectively. Left and right are in units of 8 pixels, while top and bottom are in units of 2 lines. The default is 8 pixels on each side.
        :param int jt: These options set the amount of "junk" to ignore at the left, right, top, and bottom of the image, respectively. Left and right are in units of 8 pixels, while top and bottom are in units of 2 lines. The default is 8 pixels on each side.
        :param int jb: These options set the amount of "junk" to ignore at the left, right, top, and bottom of the image, respectively. Left and right are in units of 8 pixels, while top and bottom are in units of 2 lines. The default is 8 pixels on each side.

        ### 11.204 readeia608

        Read closed captioning (EIA-608) information from the top lines of a video
        frame.

        This filter adds frame metadata for `lavfi.readeia608.X.cc` and
        `lavfi.readeia608.X.line`, where `X` is the number of the identified line with
        EIA-608 data (starting from 0). A description of each metadata value follows:

        **lavfi.readeia608.X.cc**

            The two bytes stored as EIA-608 data (printed in hexadecimal).

        **lavfi.readeia608.X.line**

            The number of the line on which the EIA-608 data was identified and read.

        This filter accepts the following options:

        **scan_min**

            Set the line to start scanning for EIA-608 data. Default is 0.

        **scan_max**

            Set the line to end scanning for EIA-608 data. Default is 29.

        **spw**

            Set the ratio of width reserved for sync code detection. Default is 0.27. Allowed range is [0.1 - 0.7].

        **chp**

            Enable checking the parity bit. In the event of a parity error, the filter will output 0x00 for that character. Default is false.

        **lp**

            Lowpass lines prior to further processing. Default is enabled.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param int scan_min: Set the line to start scanning for EIA-608 data. Default is 0.

        ### 11.208 removelogo

        Suppress a TV station logo, using an image file to determine which pixels
        comprise the logo. It works by filling in the pixels that comprise the logo
        with neighboring pixels.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **filename, f**

            Set the filter bitmap file, which can be any image format supported by libavformat. The width and height of the image file must match those of the video stream being processed.

        Pixels in the provided bitmap image with a value of zero are not considered
        part of the logo, non-zero pixels are considered part of the logo. If you use
        white (255) for the logo and black (0) for the rest, you will be safe. For
        making the filter bitmap, it is recommended to take a screen capture of a
        black frame with the logo visible, and then using a threshold filter followed
        by the erode filter once or twice.

        If needed, little splotches can be fixed manually. Remember that if logo
        pixels are not covered, the filter quality will be much reduced. Marking too
        many pixels as part of the logo does not hurt as much, but it will increase
        the amount of blurring needed to cover over the image and will destroy more
        information than necessary, and extra pixels will slow things down on a large
        logo.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        ### 11.213 rotate

        Rotate video by an arbitrary angle expressed in radians.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        A description of the optional parameters follows.

        **angle, a**

            Set an expression for the angle by which to rotate the input video clockwise, expressed as a number of radians. A negative value will result in a counter-clockwise rotation. By default it is set to "0". This expression is evaluated for each frame.

        **out_w, ow**

            Set the output width expression, default value is "iw". This expression is evaluated just once during configuration.

        **out_h, oh**

            Set the output height expression, default value is "ih". This expression is evaluated just once during configuration.

        **bilinear**

            Enable bilinear interpolation if set to 1, a value of 0 disables it. Default value is 1.

        **fillcolor, c**

            Set the color used to fill the output area not covered by the rotated image. For the general syntax of this option, check the (ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. If the special value "none" is selected then no background is printed (useful for example if the background is never shown). Default value is "black".

        The expressions for the angle and the output size can contain the following
        constants and functions:

        **n**

            sequential number of the input frame, starting from 0. It is always NAN before the first frame is filtered.

        **t**

            time in seconds of the input frame, it is set to 0 when the filter is configured. It is always NAN before the first frame is filtered.

        **hsub**

        **vsub**

            horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the pixel format "yuv422p" hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.

        **in_w, iw**

        **in_h, ih**

            the input video width and height

        **out_w, ow**

        **out_h, oh**

            the output width and height, that is the size of the padded area as specified by the width and height expressions

        **rotw(a)**

        **roth(a)**

            the minimal width/height required for completely containing the input video rotated by a radians. These are only available when computing the out_w and out_h expressions.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param str angle: Set an expression for the angle by which to rotate the input video clockwise, expressed as a number of radians. A negative value will result in a counter-clockwise rotation. By default it is set to "0". This expression is evaluated for each frame.
        :param str out_w: Set the output width expression, default value is "iw". This expression is evaluated just once during configuration.
        :param str out_h: Set the output height expression, default value is "ih". This expression is evaluated just once during configuration.

        ### 11.216 scale_cuda

        Scale (resize) and convert (pixel format) the input video, using accelerated
        CUDA kernels. Setting the output width and height works in the same way as for
        the scale filter.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **w**

        **h**

            Set the output video dimension expression. Default value is the input dimension. Allows for the same expressions as the scale filter.

        **interp_algo**

            Sets the algorithm used for scaling: nearest Nearest neighbour Used by default if input parameters match the desired output. bilinear Bilinear bicubic Bicubic This is the default. lanczos Lanczos

        **format**

            Controls the output pixel format. By default, or if none is specified, the input pixel format is used. The filter does not support converting between YUV and RGB pixel formats.

        **passthrough**

            If set to 0, every frame is processed, even if no conversion is necessary. This mode can be useful to use the filter as a buffer for a downstream frame-consumer that exhausts the limited decoder frame pool. If set to 1, frames are passed through as-is if they match the desired output parameters. This is the default behaviour.

        **param**

            Algorithm-Specific parameter. Affects the curves of the bicubic algorithm.

        **force_original_aspect_ratio**

        **force_divisible_by**

            Work the same as the identical scale filter options.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param str w: Set the output video dimension expression. Default value is the input dimension. Allows for the same expressions as the scale filter.
        :param str h: Set the output video dimension expression. Default value is the input dimension. Allows for the same expressions as the scale filter.
        :param int interp_algo: Sets the algorithm used for scaling: nearest Nearest neighbour Used by default if input parameters match the desired output. bilinear Bilinear bicubic Bicubic This is the default. lanczos Lanczos

        ### 11.217 scale_npp

        Use the NVIDIA Performance Primitives (libnpp) to perform scaling and/or pixel
        format conversion on CUDA video frames. Setting the output width and height
        works in the same way as for the scale filter.

        The following additional options are accepted:

        **format**

            The pixel format of the output CUDA frames. If set to the string "same" (the default), the input format will be kept. Note that automatic format negotiation and conversion is not yet supported for hardware frames

        **interp_algo**

            The interpolation algorithm used for resizing. One of the following: nn Nearest neighbour. linear cubic cubic2p_bspline 2-parameter cubic (B=1, C=0) cubic2p_catmullrom 2-parameter cubic (B=0, C=1/2) cubic2p_b05c03 2-parameter cubic (B=1/2, C=3/10) super Supersampling lanczos

        **force_original_aspect_ratio**

            Enable decreasing or increasing output video width or height if necessary to keep the original aspect ratio. Possible values: ‘disable’ Scale the video as specified and disable this feature. ‘decrease’ The output video dimensions will automatically be decreased if needed. ‘increase’ The output video dimensions will automatically be increased if needed. One useful instance of this option is that when you know a specific device’s maximum allowed resolution, you can use this to limit the output video to that, while retaining the aspect ratio. For example, device A allows 1280x720 playback, and your video is 1920x800. Using this option (set it to decrease) and specifying 1280x720 to the command line makes the output 1280x533. Please note that this is a different thing than specifying -1 for w or h, you still need to specify the output resolution for this option to work.

        **force_divisible_by**

            Ensures that both the output dimensions, width and height, are divisible by the given integer when used together with force_original_aspect_ratio. This works similar to using -n in the w and h options. This option respects the value set for force_original_aspect_ratio, increasing or decreasing the resolution accordingly. The video’s aspect ratio may be slightly modified. This option can be handy if you need to have a video fit within or exceed a defined resolution using force_original_aspect_ratio but also have encoder restrictions on width or height divisibility.

        **eval**

            Specify when to evaluate width and height expression. It accepts the following values: ‘init’ Only evaluate expressions once during the filter initialization or when a command is processed. ‘frame’ Evaluate expressions for each incoming frame.

        The values of the w and h options are expressions containing the following
        constants:

        **in_w**

        **in_h**

            The input width and height

        **iw**

        **ih**

            These are the same as in_w and in_h.

        **out_w**

        **out_h**

            The output (scaled) width and height

        **ow**

        **oh**

            These are the same as out_w and out_h

        **a**

            The same as iw / ih

        **sar**

            input sample aspect ratio

        **dar**

            The input display aspect ratio. Calculated from (iw / ih) * sar.

        **n**

            The (sequential) number of the input frame, starting from 0. Only available with eval=frame.

        **t**

            The presentation timestamp of the input frame, expressed as a number of seconds. Only available with eval=frame.

        **pos**

            The position (byte offset) of the frame in the input stream, or NaN if this information is unavailable and/or meaningless (for example in case of synthetic video). Only available with eval=frame. Deprecated, do not use.

        ### 11.223 scdet

        Detect video scene change.

        This filter sets frame metadata with mafd between frame, the scene score, and
        forward the frame to the next filter, so they can use these metadata to detect
        scene change or others.

        In addition, this filter logs a message and sets frame metadata when it
        detects a scene change by threshold.

        `lavfi.scd.mafd` metadata keys are set with mafd for every frame.

        `lavfi.scd.score` metadata keys are set with scene change score for every
        frame to detect scene change.

        `lavfi.scd.time` metadata keys are set with current filtered frame time which
        detect scene change with threshold.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **threshold, t**

            Set the scene change detection threshold as a percentage of maximum change. Good values are in the [8.0, 14.0] range. The range for threshold is [0., 100.]. Default value is 10..

        **sc_pass, s**

            Set the flag to pass scene change frames to the next filter. Default value is 0 You can enable it if you want to get snapshot of scene change frames only.

        ### 18.17 select, aselect

        Select frames to pass in output.

        This filter accepts the following options:

        **expr, e**

            Set expression, which is evaluated for each input frame. If the expression is evaluated to zero, the frame is discarded. If the evaluation result is negative or NaN, the frame is sent to the first output; otherwise it is sent to the output with index ceil(val)-1, assuming that the input index starts from 0. For example a value of 1.2 corresponds to the output with index ceil(1.2)-1 = 2-1 = 1, that is the second output.

        **outputs, n**

            Set the number of outputs. The output to which to send the selected frame is based on the result of the evaluation. Default value is 1.

        The expression can contain the following constants:

        **n**

            The (sequential) number of the filtered frame, starting from 0.

        **selected_n**

            The (sequential) number of the selected frame, starting from 0.

        **prev_selected_n**

            The sequential number of the last selected frame. It’s NAN if undefined.

        **TB**

            The timebase of the input timestamps.

        **pts**

            The PTS (Presentation TimeStamp) of the filtered frame, expressed in TB units. It’s NAN if undefined.

        **t**

            The PTS of the filtered frame, expressed in seconds. It’s NAN if undefined.

        **prev_pts**

            The PTS of the previously filtered frame. It’s NAN if undefined.

        **prev_selected_pts**

            The PTS of the last previously filtered frame. It’s NAN if undefined.

        **prev_selected_t**

            The PTS of the last previously selected frame, expressed in seconds. It’s NAN if undefined.

        **start_pts**

            The first PTS in the stream which is not NAN. It remains NAN if not found.

        **start_t**

            The first PTS, in seconds, in the stream which is not NAN. It remains NAN if not found.

        **pict_type (video only)**

            The type of the filtered frame. It can assume one of the following values: I P B S SI SP BI

        **interlace_type (video only)**

            The frame interlace type. It can assume one of the following values: PROGRESSIVE The frame is progressive (not interlaced). TOPFIRST The frame is top-field-first. BOTTOMFIRST The frame is bottom-field-first.

        **consumed_sample_n (audio only)**

            the number of selected samples before the current frame

        **samples_n (audio only)**

            the number of samples in the current frame

        **sample_rate (audio only)**

            the input sample rate

        **key**

            This is 1 if the filtered frame is a key-frame, 0 otherwise.

        **pos**

            the position in the file of the filtered frame, -1 if the information is not available (e.g. for synthetic video); deprecated, do not use

        **scene (video only)**

            value between 0 and 1 to indicate a new scene; a low value reflects a low probability for the current frame to introduce a new scene, while a higher value means the current frame is more likely to be one (see the example below)

        **concatdec_select**

            The concat demuxer can select only part of a concat input file by setting an inpoint and an outpoint, but the output packets may not be entirely contained in the selected interval. By using this variable, it is possible to skip frames generated by the concat demuxer which are not exactly contained in the selected interval. This works by comparing the frame pts against the lavf.concat.start_time and the lavf.concat.duration packet metadata values which are also present in the decoded frames. The concatdec_select variable is -1 if the frame pts is at least start_time and either the duration metadata is missing or the frame pts is less than start_time + duration, 0 otherwise, and NaN if the start_time metadata is missing. That basically means that an input frame is selected if its pts is within the interval set by the concat demuxer.

        The default value of the select expression is "1".



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param str expr: Set expression, which is evaluated for each input frame. If the expression is evaluated to zero, the frame is discarded. If the evaluation result is negative or NaN, the frame is sent to the first output; otherwise it is sent to the output with index ceil(val)-1, assuming that the input index starts from 0. For example a value of 1.2 corresponds to the output with index ceil(1.2)-1 = 2-1 = 1, that is the second output.
        :param int outputs: Set the number of outputs. The output to which to send the selected frame is based on the result of the evaluation. Default value is 1.

        **correction_method**

            Select color correction method. Available values are: ‘absolute’ Specified adjustments are applied "as-is" (added/subtracted to original pixel component value). ‘relative’ Specified adjustments are relative to the original component value. Default is absolute.

        **reds**

            Adjustments for red pixels (pixels where the red component is the maximum)

        **yellows**

            Adjustments for yellow pixels (pixels where the blue component is the minimum)

        **greens**

            Adjustments for green pixels (pixels where the green component is the maximum)

        **psfile**

            Specify a Photoshop selective color file (.asv) to import the settings from.

        All the adjustment settings (reds, yellows, ...) accept up to 4 space
        separated floating point adjustment values in the [-1,1] range, respectively
        to adjust the amount of cyan, magenta, yellow and black for the pixels of its

        Send commands to filters in the filtergraph.

        These filters read commands to be sent to other filters in the filtergraph.

        `sendcmd` must be inserted between two video filters, `asendcmd` must be
        inserted between two audio filters, but apart from that they act the same way.

        The specification of commands can be provided in the filter arguments with the
        commands option, or in a file specified by the filename option.

        These filters accept the following options:

        **commands, c**

            Set the commands to be read and sent to the other filters.

        **filename, f**

            Set the filename of the commands to be read and sent to the other filters.

        ----------

        :param str commands: Set the commands to be read and sent to the other filters.

        ### 11.226 setdar, setsar

        The `setdar` filter sets the Display Aspect Ratio for the filter output video.

        This is done by changing the specified Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect Ratio,
        according to the following equation:



            DAR = HORIZONTAL_RESOLUTION / VERTICAL_RESOLUTION * SAR


        Keep in mind that the `setdar` filter does not modify the pixel dimensions of
        the video frame. Also, the display aspect ratio set by this filter may be
        changed by later filters in the filterchain, e.g. in case of scaling or if
        another "setdar" or a "setsar" filter is applied.

        The `setsar` filter sets the Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect Ratio for the filter
        output video.

        Note that as a consequence of the application of this filter, the output
        display aspect ratio will change according to the equation above.

        Keep in mind that the sample aspect ratio set by the `setsar` filter may be
        changed by later filters in the filterchain, e.g. if another "setsar" or a
        "setdar" filter is applied.

        It accepts the following parameters:

        **r, ratio, dar (setdar only), sar (setsar only)**

            Set the aspect ratio used by the filter. The parameter can be a floating point number string, or an expression. If the parameter is not specified, the value "0" is assumed, meaning that the same input value is used.

        **max**

            Set the maximum integer value to use for expressing numerator and denominator when reducing the expressed aspect ratio to a rational. Default value is 100.

        The parameter sar is an expression containing the following constants:

        **w, h**

            The input width and height.

        **a**

            Same as w / h.

        **sar**

            The input sample aspect ratio.

        **dar**

            The input display aspect ratio. It is the same as (w / h) * sar.

        **hsub, vsub**

            Horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example, for the pixel format "yuv422p" hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param str dar: Set the aspect ratio used by the filter. The parameter can be a floating point number string, or an expression. If the parameter is not specified, the value "0" is assumed, meaning that the same input value is used.
        :param int max: Set the maximum integer value to use for expressing numerator and denominator when reducing the expressed aspect ratio to a rational. Default value is 100.

            the time in seconds of the first frame

        **INTERLACED**

            State whether the current frame is interlaced.

        **T**

            the time in seconds of the current frame

        **POS**

            original position in the file of the frame, or undefined if undefined for the current frame; deprecated, do not use

        **PREV_INPTS**

        ### 11.226 setdar, setsar

        The `setdar` filter sets the Display Aspect Ratio for the filter output video.

        This is done by changing the specified Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect Ratio,
        according to the following equation:



            DAR = HORIZONTAL_RESOLUTION / VERTICAL_RESOLUTION * SAR


        Keep in mind that the `setdar` filter does not modify the pixel dimensions of
        the video frame. Also, the display aspect ratio set by this filter may be
        changed by later filters in the filterchain, e.g. in case of scaling or if
        another "setdar" or a "setsar" filter is applied.

        The `setsar` filter sets the Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect Ratio for the filter
        output video.

        Note that as a consequence of the application of this filter, the output
        display aspect ratio will change according to the equation above.

        Keep in mind that the sample aspect ratio set by the `setsar` filter may be
        changed by later filters in the filterchain, e.g. if another "setsar" or a
        "setdar" filter is applied.

        It accepts the following parameters:

        **r, ratio, dar (setdar only), sar (setsar only)**

            Set the aspect ratio used by the filter. The parameter can be a floating point number string, or an expression. If the parameter is not specified, the value "0" is assumed, meaning that the same input value is used.

        **max**

            Set the maximum integer value to use for expressing numerator and denominator when reducing the expressed aspect ratio to a rational. Default value is 100.

        The parameter sar is an expression containing the following constants:

        **w, h**

            The input width and height.

        **a**

            Same as w / h.

        **sar**

            The input sample aspect ratio.

        **dar**

            The input display aspect ratio. It is the same as (w / h) * sar.

        **hsub, vsub**

            Horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example, for the pixel format "yuv422p" hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param str sar: Set the aspect ratio used by the filter. The parameter can be a floating point number string, or an expression. If the parameter is not specified, the value "0" is assumed, meaning that the same input value is used.
        :param int max: Set the maximum integer value to use for expressing numerator and denominator when reducing the expressed aspect ratio to a rational. Default value is 100.

        **out**

             stat specify an additional form of image analysis. out output video with the specified type of pixel highlighted. Both options accept the following values: ‘tout’ Identify temporal outliers pixels. A temporal outlier is a pixel unlike the neighboring pixels of the same field. Examples of temporal outliers include the results of video dropouts, head clogs, or tape tracking issues. ‘vrep’ Identify vertical line repetition. Vertical line repetition includes similar rows of pixels within a frame. In born-digital video vertical line repetition is common, but this pattern is uncommon in video digitized from an analog source. When it occurs in video that results from the digitization of an analog source it can indicate concealment from a dropout compensator. ‘brng’ Identify pixels that fall outside of legal broadcast range.

        **color, c**

            Set the highlight color for the out option. The default color is yellow.

        Synthesize audio from 2 input video spectrums, first input stream represents
        magnitude across time and second represents phase across time. The filter will
        transform from frequency domain as displayed in videos back to time domain as
        presented in audio output.

        This filter is primarily created for reversing processed showspectrum filter
        outputs, but can synthesize sound from other spectrograms too. But in such
        case results are going to be poor if the phase data is not available, because
        in such cases phase data need to be recreated, usually it’s just recreated
        from random noise. For best results use gray only output (`channel` color mode
        in showspectrum filter) and `log` scale for magnitude video and `lin` scale
        for phase video. To produce phase, for 2nd video, use `data` option. Inputs
        videos should generally use `fullframe` slide mode as that saves resources
        needed for decoding video.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **sample_rate**

            Specify sample rate of output audio, the sample rate of audio from which spectrum was generated may differ.

        **channels**

            Set number of channels represented in input video spectrums.

        **scale**

            Set scale which was used when generating magnitude input spectrum. Can be lin or log. Default is log.

        **slide**

            Set slide which was used when generating inputs spectrums. Can be replace, scroll, fullframe or rscroll. Default is fullframe.

        **win_func**

            Set window function used for resynthesis.

        **overlap**

            Set window overlap. In range [0, 1]. Default is 1, which means optimal overlap for selected window function will be picked.

        **orientation**

            Set orientation of input videos. Can be vertical or horizontal. Default is vertical.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param int sample_rate: Specify sample rate of output audio, the sample rate of audio from which spectrum was generated may differ.
        :param int channels: Set number of channels represented in input video spectrums.

        ### 11.241 spp

        Apply a simple postprocessing filter that compresses and decompresses the
        image at several (or - in the case of quality level `6` \- all) shifts and
        average the results.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **quality**

            Set quality. This option defines the number of levels for averaging. It accepts an integer in the range 0-6. If set to 0, the filter will have no effect. A value of 6 means the higher quality. For each increment of that value the speed drops by a factor of approximately 2. Default value is 3\.

        **qp**

            Force a constant quantization parameter. If not set, the filter will use the QP from the video stream (if available).

        **mode**

            Set thresholding mode. Available modes are: ‘hard’ Set hard thresholding (default). ‘soft’ Set soft thresholding (better de-ringing effect, but likely blurrier).

        **use_bframe_qp**

            Enable the use of the QP from the B-Frames if set to 1. Using this option may cause flicker since the B-Frames have often larger QP. Default is 0 (not enabled).



        Parameters:

        ### 11.243 ssim

        Obtain the SSIM (Structural SImilarity Metric) between two input videos.

        This filter takes in input two input videos, the first input is considered the
        "main" source and is passed unchanged to the output. The second input is used
        as a "reference" video for computing the SSIM.

        Both video inputs must have the same resolution and pixel format for this
        filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs have the same
        number of frames, which are compared one by one.

        The filter stores the calculated SSIM of each frame.

        The description of the accepted parameters follows.

        **stats_file, f**

            If specified the filter will use the named file to save the SSIM of each individual frame. When filename equals "-" the data is sent to standard output.

        The file printed if stats_file is selected, contains a sequence of key/value
        pairs of the form key:value for each compared couple of frames.

        A description of each shown parameter follows:

        **n**

            sequential number of the input frame, starting from 1

        **Y, U, V, R, G, B**

            SSIM of the compared frames for the component specified by the suffix.

        **All**

            SSIM of the compared frames for the whole frame.

        **dB**

            Same as above but in dB representation.

        This filter also supports the framesync options.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        ### 11.246 subtitles

        Draw subtitles on top of input video using the libass library.

        To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with
        `--enable-libass`. This filter also requires a build with libavcodec and
        libavformat to convert the passed subtitles file to ASS (Advanced Substation
        Alpha) subtitles format.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **filename, f**

            Set the filename of the subtitle file to read. It must be specified.

        **original_size**

            Specify the size of the original video, the video for which the ASS file was composed. For the syntax of this option, check the (ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. Due to a misdesign in ASS aspect ratio arithmetic, this is necessary to correctly scale the fonts if the aspect ratio has been changed.

        **fontsdir**

            Set a directory path containing fonts that can be used by the filter. These fonts will be used in addition to whatever the font provider uses.

        **alpha**

            Process alpha channel, by default alpha channel is untouched.

        **charenc**

            Set subtitles input character encoding. subtitles filter only. Only useful if not UTF-8.

        **stream_index, si**

            Set subtitles stream index. subtitles filter only.

        **force_style**

            Override default style or script info parameters of the subtitles. It accepts a string containing ASS style format KEY=VALUE couples separated by ",".

        **wrap_unicode**

            Break lines according to the Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm. Availability requires at least libass release 0.17.0 (or LIBASS_VERSION 0x01600010), and libass must have been built with libunibreak. The option is enabled by default except for native ASS.

        If the first key is not specified, it is assumed that the first value
        specifies the filename.

        For example, to render the file sub.srt on top of the input video, use the
        command:



            subtitles=sub.srt


        which is equivalent to:



            subtitles=filename=sub.srt


        To render the default subtitles stream from file video.mkv, use:



            subtitles=video.mkv


        To render the second subtitles stream from that file, use:



            subtitles=video.mkv:si=1


        To make the subtitles stream from sub.srt appear in 80% transparent blue
        `DejaVu Serif`, use:



            subtitles=sub.srt:force_style='Fontname=DejaVu Serif,PrimaryColour=&HCCFF0000'

        ### 11.252 thistogram

        Compute and draw a color distribution histogram for the input video across
        time.

        Unlike histogram video filter which only shows histogram of single input frame
        at certain time, this filter shows also past histograms of number of frames
        defined by `width` option.

        The computed histogram is a representation of the color component distribution
        in an image.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **width, w**

            Set width of single color component output. Default value is 0. Value of 0 means width will be picked from input video. This also set number of passed histograms to keep. Allowed range is [0, 8192].

        **display_mode, d**

            Set display mode. It accepts the following values: ‘stack’ Per color component graphs are placed below each other. ‘parade’ Per color component graphs are placed side by side. ‘overlay’ Presents information identical to that in the parade, except that the graphs representing color components are superimposed directly over one another. Default is stack.

        **levels_mode, m**

            Set mode. Can be either linear, or logarithmic. Default is linear.

        **components, c**

            Set what color components to display. Default is 7.

        **bgopacity, b**

            Set background opacity. Default is 0.9.

        **envelope, e**

            Show envelope. Default is disabled.

        **ecolor, ec**

            Set envelope color. Default is gold.

        **slide**

            Set slide mode. Available values for slide is: ‘frame’ Draw new frame when right border is reached. ‘replace’ Replace old columns with new ones. ‘scroll’ Scroll from right to left. ‘rscroll’ Scroll from left to right. ‘picture’ Draw single picture. Default is replace.



        Parameters:

        Apply threshold effect to video stream.

        This filter needs four video streams to perform thresholding. First stream is
        stream we are filtering. Second stream is holding threshold values, third
        stream is holding min values, and last, fourth stream is holding max values.

        The filter accepts the following option:

        **planes**

            Set which planes will be processed, unprocessed planes will be copied. By default value 0xf, all planes will be processed.

        For example if first stream pixel’s component value is less then threshold
        value of pixel component from 2nd threshold stream, third stream value will
        picked, otherwise fourth stream pixel component value will be picked.

        ### 11.256 tiltandshift

        What happens when you invert time and space?

        Normally a video is composed of several frames that represent a different
        instant of time and shows a scence that evolves in the space captured by the
        frame. This filter is the antipode of that concept, taking inspiration by tilt
        and shift photography.

        A filtered frame contains the whole timeline of events composing the sequence,
        and this is obtained by placing a slice of pixels from each frame into a
        single one. However, since there are no infinite-width frames, this is done up
        the width of the input frame, and a video is recomposed by shifting away one
        column for each subsequent frame. In order to map space to time, the filter
        tilts each input frame as well, so that motion is preseved. This is
        accomplished by progressively selecting a different column from each input
        frame.

        The end result is a sort of inverted parralax, so that far away objects move
        much faster that the ones in the front. The ideal conditions for this video
        effect are when there is either very little motion and the backgroud is
        static, or when there is a lot of motion and a very wide depth of field (eg.
        wide panorama, while moving on a train).

        The filter accepts the following parameters:

        **tilt**

            Tilt video while shifting (default). When unset, video will be sliding a static image, composed of the first column of each frame.

        **start**

            What to do at the start of filtering (see below).

        **end**

            What to do at the end of filtering (see below).

        **hold**

            How many columns should pass through before start of filtering.

        **pad**

            How many columns should be inserted before end of filtering.

        Normally the filter shifts and tils from the very first frame, and stops when
        the last one is received. However, before filtering starts, normal video may
        be preseved, so that the effect is slowly shifted in its place. Similarly, the
        last video frame may be reconstructed at the end. Alternatively it is possible
        to just start and end with black.

        **‘none’**

            Filtering is starts immediately and ends when the last frame is received.

        **‘frame’**

            The first frames or the very last frame are kept intact during processing.

        **‘black’**

            Black is padded at the beginning or at the end of filtering.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param int tilt: Tilt video while shifting (default). When unset, video will be sliding a static image, composed of the first column of each frame.
        :param int start: What to do at the start of filtering (see below).
        :param int end: What to do at the end of filtering (see below).
        :param int hold: How many columns should pass through before start of filtering.
        :param int pad: How many columns should be inserted before end of filtering.

        ### 11.257 tinterlace

        Perform various types of temporal field interlacing.

        Frames are counted starting from 1, so the first input frame is considered
        odd.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **mode**

            Specify the mode of the interlacing. This option can also be specified as a value alone. See below for a list of values for this option. Available values are: ‘merge, 0’ Move odd frames into the upper field, even into the lower field, generating a double height frame at half frame rate. \------> time Input: Frame 1 Frame 2 Frame 3 Frame 4 11111 22222 33333 44444 11111 22222 33333 44444 11111 22222 33333 44444 11111 22222 33333 44444 Output: 11111 33333 22222 44444 11111 33333 22222 44444 11111 33333 22222 44444 11111 33333 22222 44444 ‘drop_even, 1’ Only output odd frames, even frames are dropped, generating a frame with unchanged height at half frame rate. \------> time Input: Frame 1 Frame 2 Frame 3 Frame 4 11111 22222 33333 44444 11111 22222 33333 44444 11111 22222 33333 44444 11111 22222 33333 44444 Output: 11111 33333 11111 33333 11111 33333 11111 33333 ‘drop_odd, 2’ Only output even frames, odd frames are dropped, generating a frame with unchanged height at half frame rate. \------> time Input: Frame 1 Frame 2 Frame 3 Frame 4 11111 22222 33333 44444 11111 22222 33333 44444 11111 22222 33333 44444 11111 22222 33333 44444 Output: 22222 44444 22222 44444 22222 44444 22222 44444 ‘pad, 3’ Expand each frame to full height, but pad alternate lines with black, generating a frame with double height at the same input frame rate. \------> time Input: Frame 1 Frame 2 Frame 3 Frame 4 11111 22222 33333 44444 11111 22222 33333 44444 11111 22222 33333 44444 11111 22222 33333 44444 Output: 11111 ..... 33333 ..... ..... 22222 ..... 44444 11111 ..... 33333 ..... ..... 22222 ..... 44444 11111 ..... 33333 ..... ..... 22222 ..... 44444 11111 ..... 33333 ..... ..... 22222 ..... 44444 ‘interleave_top, 4’ Interleave the upper field from odd frames with the lower field from even frames, generating a frame with unchanged height at half frame rate. \------> time Input: Frame 1 Frame 2 Frame 3 Frame 4 11111<\- 22222 33333<\- 44444 11111 22222<\- 33333 44444<\- 11111<\- 22222 33333<\- 44444 11111 22222<\- 33333 44444<\- Output: 11111 33333 22222 44444 11111 33333 22222 44444 ‘interleave_bottom, 5’ Interleave the lower field from odd frames with the upper field from even frames, generating a frame with unchanged height at half frame rate. \------> time Input: Frame 1 Frame 2 Frame 3 Frame 4 11111 22222<\- 33333 44444<\- 11111<\- 22222 33333<\- 44444 11111 22222<\- 33333 44444<\- 11111<\- 22222 33333<\- 44444 Output: 22222 44444 11111 33333 22222 44444 11111 33333 ‘interlacex2, 6’ Double frame rate with unchanged height.

Default mode is merge.

        **flags**

            Specify flags influencing the filter process. Available value for flags is: low_pass_filter, vlpf Enable linear vertical low-pass filtering in the filter. Vertical low-pass filtering is required when creating an interlaced destination from a progressive source which contains high-frequency vertical detail. Filtering will reduce interlace ’twitter’ and Moire patterning. complex_filter, cvlpf Enable complex vertical low-pass filtering. This will slightly less reduce interlace ’twitter’ and Moire patterning but better retain detail and subjective sharpness impression. bypass_il Bypass already interlaced frames, only adjust the frame rate. Vertical low-pass filtering and bypassing already interlaced frames can only be enabled for mode interleave_top and interleave_bottom.

        ### 11.154 lut2, tlut2

        The `lut2` filter takes two input streams and outputs one stream.

        The `tlut2` (time lut2) filter takes two consecutive frames from one single
        stream.

        This filter accepts the following parameters:

        **c0**

            set first pixel component expression

        **c1**

            set second pixel component expression

        **c2**

            set third pixel component expression

        **c3**

            set fourth pixel component expression, corresponds to the alpha component

        **d**

            set output bit depth, only available for lut2 filter. By default is 0, which means bit depth is automatically picked from first input format.

        The `lut2` filter also supports the framesync options.

        Each of them specifies the expression to use for computing the lookup table
        for the corresponding pixel component values.

        The exact component associated to each of the c* options depends on the format
        in inputs.

        The expressions can contain the following constants:

        **w**

        **h**

            The input width and height.

        **x**

            The first input value for the pixel component.

        **y**

            The second input value for the pixel component.

        **bdx**

            The first input video bit depth.

        **bdy**

            The second input video bit depth.

        All expressions default to "x".

        ### 11.259 tmidequalizer

        Apply Temporal Midway Video Equalization effect.

        Midway Video Equalization adjusts a sequence of video frames to have the same
        histograms, while maintaining their dynamics as much as possible. It’s useful
        for e.g. matching exposures from a video frames sequence.

        This filter accepts the following option:

        **radius**

            Set filtering radius. Default is 5. Allowed range is from 1 to 127.

        **sigma**

            Set filtering sigma. Default is 0.5. This controls strength of filtering. Setting this option to 0 effectively does nothing.

        **planes**

            Set which planes to process. Default is 15, which is all available planes.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param int radius: Set filtering radius. Default is 5. Allowed range is from 1 to 127.

        ### 11.261 tonemap

        Tone map colors from different dynamic ranges.

        This filter expects data in single precision floating point, as it needs to
        operate on (and can output) out-of-range values. Another filter, such as
        zscale, is needed to convert the resulting frame to a usable format.

        The tonemapping algorithms implemented only work on linear light, so input
        data should be linearized beforehand (and possibly correctly tagged).

        ### 12.16 tonemap_opencl

        Perform HDR(PQ/HLG) to SDR conversion with tone-mapping.

        It accepts the following parameters:

        **tonemap**

            Specify the tone-mapping operator to be used. Same as tonemap option in tonemap.

        **param**

            Tune the tone mapping algorithm. same as param option in tonemap.

        **desat**

            Apply desaturation for highlights that exceed this level of brightness. The higher the parameter, the more color information will be preserved. This setting helps prevent unnaturally blown-out colors for super-highlights, by (smoothly) turning into white instead. This makes images feel more natural, at the cost of reducing information about out-of-range colors. The default value is 0.5, and the algorithm here is a little different from the cpu version tonemap currently. A setting of 0.0 disables this option.

        **threshold**

            The tonemapping algorithm parameters is fine-tuned per each scene. And a threshold is used to detect whether the scene has changed or not. If the distance between the current frame average brightness and the current running average exceeds a threshold value, we would re-calculate scene average and peak brightness. The default value is 0.2.

        **format**

            Specify the output pixel format. Currently supported formats are: p010 nv12

        **range, r**

            Set the output color range. Possible values are: tv/mpeg pc/jpeg Default is same as input.

        **primaries, p**

            Set the output color primaries. Possible values are: bt709 bt2020 Default is same as input.

        **transfer, t**

            Set the output transfer characteristics. Possible values are: bt709 bt2020 Default is bt709.

        **matrix, m**

            Set the output colorspace matrix. Possible value are: bt709 bt2020 Default is same as input.

            Specify the transposition direction. Can assume the following values: ‘0, 4, cclock_flip’ Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise and vertically flip (default), that is: L.R L.l . . -> . . l.r R.r ‘1, 5, clock’ Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise, that is: L.R l.L . . -> . . l.r r.R ‘2, 6, cclock’ Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise, that is: L.R R.r . . -> . . l.r L.l ‘3, 7, clock_flip’ Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and vertically flip, that is: L.R r.R . . -> . . l.r l.L For values between 4-7, the transposition is only done if the input video geometry is portrait and not landscape. These values are deprecated, the passthrough option should be used instead. Numerical values are deprecated, and should be dropped in favor of symbolic constants.

        **passthrough**

            Do not apply the transposition if the input geometry matches the one specified by the specified value. It accepts the following values: ‘none’ Always apply transposition. ‘portrait’ Preserve portrait geometry (when height >= width). ‘landscape’ Preserve landscape geometry (when width >= height). Default value is none.

        ### 11.265 trim

        Trim the input so that the output contains one continuous subpart of the
        input.

        It accepts the following parameters:

        **start**

            Specify the time of the start of the kept section, i.e. the frame with the timestamp start will be the first frame in the output.

        **end**

            Specify the time of the first frame that will be dropped, i.e. the frame immediately preceding the one with the timestamp end will be the last frame in the output.

        **start_pts**

            This is the same as start, except this option sets the start timestamp in timebase units instead of seconds.

        **end_pts**

            This is the same as end, except this option sets the end timestamp in timebase units instead of seconds.

        **duration**

            The maximum duration of the output in seconds.

        **start_frame**

            The number of the first frame that should be passed to the output.

        **end_frame**

            The number of the first frame that should be dropped.

        start, end, and duration are expressed as time duration specifications; see
        [(ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1)
        manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#time-duration-syntax) for the accepted syntax.

        Note that the first two sets of the start/end options and the duration option
        look at the frame timestamp, while the _frame variants simply count the frames
        that pass through the filter. Also note that this filter does not modify the
        timestamps. If you wish for the output timestamps to start at zero, insert a
        setpts filter after the trim filter.

        If multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries to be greedy and
        keep all the frames that match at least one of the specified constraints. To
        keep only the part that matches all the constraints at once, chain multiple
        trim filters.

        The defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is possible to set
        e.g. just the end values to keep everything before the specified time.

        Examples:

          * Drop everything except the second minute of input:

                ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf trim=60:120


          * Keep only the first second:

                ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf trim=duration=1

        ### 11.269 uspp

        Apply ultra slow/simple postprocessing filter that compresses and decompresses
        the image at several (or - in the case of quality level `8` \- all) shifts and
        average the results.

        The way this differs from the behavior of spp is that uspp actually encodes &
        decodes each case with libavcodec Snow, whereas spp uses a simplified intra
        only 8x8 DCT similar to MJPEG.

        This filter is only available in ffmpeg version 4.4 or earlier.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **quality**

            Set quality. This option defines the number of levels for averaging. It accepts an integer in the range 0-8. If set to 0, the filter will have no effect. A value of 8 means the higher quality. For each increment of that value the speed drops by a factor of approximately 2. Default value is 3\.

        **qp**

            Force a constant quantization parameter. If not set, the filter will use the QP from the video stream (if available).

        **codec**

            Use specified codec instead of snow.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param int quality: Set quality. This option defines the number of levels for averaging. It accepts an integer in the range 0-8. If set to 0, the filter will have no effect. A value of 8 means the higher quality. For each increment of that value the speed drops by a factor of approximately 2. Default value is 3.
        :param int qp: Force a constant quantization parameter. If not set, the filter will use the QP from the video stream (if available).
        :param bool use_bframe_qp: None
        :param str codec: Use specified codec instead of snow.

        ### 11.271 vaguedenoiser

        Apply a wavelet based denoiser.

        It transforms each frame from the video input into the wavelet domain, using
        Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau 9/7. Then it applies some filtering to the obtained
        coefficients. It does an inverse wavelet transform after. Due to wavelet
        properties, it should give a nice smoothed result, and reduced noise, without
        blurring picture features.

        This filter accepts the following options:

        **threshold**

            The filtering strength. The higher, the more filtered the video will be. Hard thresholding can use a higher threshold than soft thresholding before the video looks overfiltered. Default value is 2.

        **method**

            The filtering method the filter will use. It accepts the following values: ‘hard’ All values under the threshold will be zeroed. ‘soft’ All values under the threshold will be zeroed. All values above will be reduced by the threshold. ‘garrote’ Scales or nullifies coefficients - intermediary between (more) soft and (less) hard thresholding. Default is garrote.

        **nsteps**

            Number of times, the wavelet will decompose the picture. Picture can’t be decomposed beyond a particular point (typically, 8 for a 640x480 frame - as 2^9 = 512 > 480). Valid values are integers between 1 and 32. Default value is 6.

        **percent**

            Partial of full denoising (limited coefficients shrinking), from 0 to 100. Default value is 85.

        **planes**

            A list of the planes to process. By default all planes are processed.

        **type**

            The threshold type the filter will use. It accepts the following values: ‘universal’ Threshold used is same for all decompositions. ‘bayes’ Threshold used depends also on each decomposition coefficients. Default is universal.



        Parameters:

        :param float threshold: The filtering strength. The higher, the more filtered the video will be. Hard thresholding can use a higher threshold than soft thresholding before the video looks overfiltered. Default value is 2.

        ### 11.273 vectorscope

        Display 2 color component values in the two dimensional graph (which is called
        a vectorscope).

        This filter accepts the following options:

        **mode, m**

            Set vectorscope mode. It accepts the following values: ‘gray’ ‘tint’ Gray values are displayed on graph, higher brightness means more pixels have same component color value on location in graph. This is the default mode. ‘color’ Gray values are displayed on graph. Surrounding pixels values which are not present in video frame are drawn in gradient of 2 color components which are set by option x and y. The 3rd color component is static. ‘color2’ Actual color components values present in video frame are displayed on graph. ‘color3’ Similar as color2 but higher frequency of same values x and y on graph increases value of another color component, which is luminance by default values of x and y. ‘color4’ Actual colors present in video frame are displayed on graph. If two different colors map to same position on graph then color with higher value of component not present in graph is picked. ‘color5’ Gray values are displayed on graph. Similar to color but with 3rd color component picked from radial gradient.

        **x**

            Set which color component will be represented on X-axis. Default is 1.

        **y**

            Set which color component will be represented on Y-axis. Default is 2.

        **intensity, i**

            Set intensity, used by modes: gray, color, color3 and color5 for increasing brightness of color component which represents frequency of (X, Y) location in graph.

        **envelope, e**

             ‘none’ No envelope, this is default. ‘instant’ Instant envelope, even darkest single pixel will be clearly highlighted. ‘peak’ Hold maximum and minimum values presented in graph over time. This way you can still spot out of range values without constantly looking at vectorscope. ‘peak+instant’ Peak and instant envelope combined together.

        **graticule, g**

            Set what kind of graticule to draw. ‘none’ ‘green’ ‘color’ ‘invert’

        **opacity, o**

            Set graticule opacity.

        **flags, f**

            Set graticule flags. ‘white’ Draw graticule for white point. ‘black’ Draw graticule for black point. ‘name’ Draw color points short names.

        **bgopacity, b**

            Set background opacity.

        **lthreshold, l**

            Set low threshold for color component not represented on X or Y axis. Values lower than this value will be ignored. Default is 0. Note this value is multiplied with actual max possible value one pixel component can have. So for 8-bit input and low threshold value of 0.1 actual threshold is 0.1 * 255 = 25.

        **hthreshold, h**

            Set high threshold for color component not represented on X or Y axis. Values higher than this value will be ignored. Default is 1. Note this value is multiplied with actual max possible value one pixel component can have. So for 8-bit input and high threshold value of 0.9 actual threshold is 0.9 * 255 = 230.

        **colorspace, c**

            Set what kind of colorspace to use when drawing graticule. ‘auto’ ‘601’ ‘709’ Default is auto.

        **tint0, t0**

        **tint1, t1**

            Set color tint for gray/tint vectorscope mode. By default both options are zero. This means no tint, and output will remain gray.

        ### 11.274 vidstabdetect

        Analyze video stabilization/deshaking. Perform pass 1 of 2, see
        vidstabtransform for pass 2.

        This filter generates a file with relative translation and rotation transform
        information about subsequent frames, which is then used by the
        vidstabtransform filter.

        To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with
        `--enable-libvidstab`.

        This filter accepts the following options:

        **result**

            Set the path to the file used to write the transforms information. Default value is transforms.trf.

        **shakiness**

            Set how shaky the video is and how quick the camera is. It accepts an integer in the range 1-10, a value of 1 means little shakiness, a value of 10 means strong shakiness. Default value is 5.

        **accuracy**

            Set the accuracy of the detection process. It must be a value in the range 1-15. A value of 1 means low accuracy, a value of 15 means high accuracy. Default value is 15.

        **stepsize**

            Set stepsize of the search process. The region around minimum is scanned with 1 pixel resolution. Default value is 6.

        **mincontrast**

            Set minimum contrast. Below this value a local measurement field is discarded. Must be a floating point value in the range 0-1. Default value is 0.3.

        **tripod**

            Set reference frame number for tripod mode. If enabled, the motion of the frames is compared to a reference frame in the filtered stream, identified by the specified number. The idea is to compensate all movements in a more-or-less static scene and keep the camera view absolutely still. If set to 0, it is disabled. The frames are counted starting from 1.

        **show**

            Show fields and transforms in the resulting frames. It accepts an integer in the range 0-2. Default value is 0, which disables any visualization.

        **fileformat**

            Format for the transforms data file to be written. Acceptable values are ‘ascii’ Human-readable plain text ‘binary’ Binary format, roughly 40% smaller than ascii. (default)



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param str result: Set the path to the file used to write the transforms information. Default value is transforms.trf.
        :param int shakiness: Set how shaky the video is and how quick the camera is. It accepts an integer in the range 1-10, a value of 1 means little shakiness, a value of 10 means strong shakiness. Default value is 5.
        :param int accuracy: Set the accuracy of the detection process. It must be a value in the range 1-15. A value of 1 means low accuracy, a value of 15 means high accuracy. Default value is 15.
        :param int stepsize: Set stepsize of the search process. The region around minimum is scanned with 1 pixel resolution. Default value is 6.
        :param float mincontrast: Set minimum contrast. Below this value a local measurement field is discarded. Must be a floating point value in the range 0-1. Default value is 0.3.
        :param int show: Show fields and transforms in the resulting frames. It accepts an integer in the range 0-2. Default value is 0, which disables any visualization.
        :param int tripod: Set reference frame number for tripod mode.

        ### 11.279 vif

        Obtain the average VIF (Visual Information Fidelity) between two input videos.

        This filter takes two input videos.

        filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs have the same
        number of frames, which are compared one by one.

        The obtained average VIF score is printed through the logging system.

        The filter stores the calculated VIF score of each frame.

        This filter also supports the framesync options.

        ### 11.280 vignette

        Make or reverse a natural vignetting effect.

        The filter accepts the following options:

        **angle, a**

            Set lens angle expression as a number of radians. The value is clipped in the [0,PI/2] range. Default value: "PI/5"

        **x0**

        **y0**

            Set center coordinates expressions. Respectively "w/2" and "h/2" by default.

        **mode**

            Set forward/backward mode. Available modes are: ‘forward’ The larger the distance from the central point, the darker the image becomes. ‘backward’ The larger the distance from the central point, the brighter the image becomes. This can be used to reverse a vignette effect, though there is no automatic detection to extract the lens angle and other settings (yet). It can also be used to create a burning effect. Default value is ‘forward’.

        **eval**

            Set evaluation mode for the expressions (angle, x0, y0). It accepts the following values: ‘init’ Evaluate expressions only once during the filter initialization. ‘frame’ Evaluate expressions for each incoming frame. This is way slower than the ‘init’ mode since it requires all the scalers to be re-computed, but it allows advanced dynamic expressions. Default value is ‘init’.

        **dither**

            Set dithering to reduce the circular banding effects. Default is 1 (enabled).

        **aspect**

            Set vignette aspect. This setting allows one to adjust the shape of the vignette. Setting this value to the SAR of the input will make a rectangular vignetting following the dimensions of the video. Default is 1/1.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param str angle: Set lens angle expression as a number of radians. The value is clipped in the [0,PI/2] range. Default value: "PI/5"
        :param str x0: Set center coordinates expressions. Respectively "w/2" and "h/2" by default.

        Filter").

        Based on the process described by Martin Weston for BBC R&D, and implemented
        based on the de-interlace algorithm written by Jim Easterbrook for BBC R&D,
        the Weston 3 field deinterlacing filter uses filter coefficients calculated by
        BBC R&D.

        This filter uses field-dominance information in frame to decide which of each
        pair of fields to place first in the output. If it gets it wrong use setfield
        filter before `w3fdif` filter.

        There are two sets of filter coefficients, so called "simple" and "complex".
        Which set of filter coefficients is used can be set by passing an optional
        parameter:

        **filter**

            Set the interlacing filter coefficients. Accepts one of the following values: ‘simple’ Simple filter coefficient set. ‘complex’ More-complex filter coefficient set. Default value is ‘complex’.

        **mode**

            The interlacing mode to adopt. It accepts one of the following values: frame Output one frame for each frame. field Output one frame for each field. The default value is field.

        **parity**

            The picture field parity assumed for the input interlaced video. It accepts one of the following values: tff Assume the top field is first. bff Assume the bottom field is first. auto Enable automatic detection of field parity. The default value is auto. If the interlacing is unknown or the decoder does not export this information, top field first will be assumed.

        **deint**

            Specify which frames to deinterlace. Accepts one of the following values: ‘all’ Deinterlace all frames, ‘interlaced’ Only deinterlace frames marked as interlaced. Default value is ‘all’.



        Parameters:
        ----------

        :param int filter: Set the interlacing filter coefficients. Accepts one of the following values: ‘simple’ Simple filter coefficient set. ‘complex’ More-complex filter coefficient set. Default value is ‘complex’.

        ### 11.284 waveform

        Video waveform monitor.

        The waveform monitor plots color component intensity. By default luma only.
        Each column of the waveform corresponds to a column of pixels in the source
        video.

        It accepts the following options:

        **mode, m**

            Can be either row, or column. Default is column. In row mode, the graph on the left side represents color component value 0 and the right side represents value = 255. In column mode, the top side represents color component value = 0 and bottom side represents value = 255.

        **intensity, i**

            Set intensity. Smaller values are useful to find out how many values of the same luminance are distributed across input rows/columns. Default value is 0.04. Allowed range is [0, 1].

        **mirror, r**

            Set mirroring mode. 0 means unmirrored, 1 means mirrored. In mirrored mode, higher values will be represented on the left side for row mode and at the top for column mode. Default is 1 (mirrored).

        **display, d**

            Set display mode. It accepts the following values: ‘overlay’ Presents information identical to that in the parade, except that the graphs representing color components are superimposed directly over one another. This display mode makes it easier to spot relative differences or similarities in overlapping areas of the color components that are supposed to be identical, such as neutral whites, grays, or blacks. ‘stack’ Display separate graph for the color components side by side in row mode or one below the other in column mode. ‘parade’ Display separate graph for the color components side by side in column mode or one below the other in row mode. Using this display mode makes it easy to spot color casts in the highlights and shadows of an image, by comparing the contours of the top and the bottom graphs of each waveform. Since whites, grays, and blacks are characterized by exactly equal amounts of red, green, and blue, neutral areas of the picture should display three waveforms of roughly equal width/height. If not, the correction is easy to perform by making level adjustments the three waveforms. Default is stack.

        **components, c**

            Set which color components to display. Default is 1, which means only luma or red color component if input is in RGB colorspace. If is set for example to 7 it will display all 3 (if) available color components.

        **envelope, e**

             ‘none’ No envelope, this is default. ‘instant’ Instant envelope, minimum and maximum values presented in graph will be easily visible even with small step value. ‘peak’ Hold minimum and maximum values presented in graph across time. This way you can still spot out of range values without constantly looking at waveforms. ‘peak+instant’ Peak and instant envelope combined together.

        **filter, f**

             ‘lowpass’ No filtering, this is default. ‘flat’ Luma and chroma combined together. ‘aflat’ Similar as above, but shows difference between blue and red chroma. ‘xflat’ Similar as above, but use different colors. ‘yflat’ Similar as above, but again with different colors. ‘chroma’ Displays only chroma. ‘color’ Displays actual color value on waveform. ‘acolor’ Similar as above, but with luma showing frequency of chroma values.

        **graticule, g**

            Set which graticule to display. ‘none’ Do not display graticule. ‘green’ Display green graticule showing legal broadcast ranges. ‘orange’ Display orange graticule showing legal broadcast ranges. ‘invert’ Display invert graticule showing legal broadcast ranges.

        **opacity, o**

            Set graticule opacity.

        **flags, fl**

            Set graticule flags. ‘numbers’ Draw numbers above lines. By default enabled. ‘dots’ Draw dots instead of lines.

        **scale, s**

            Set scale used for displaying graticule. ‘digital’ ‘millivolts’ ‘ire’ Default is digital.

        **bgopacity, b**

            Set background opacity.

        **tint0, t0**

        **tint1, t1**

            Set tint for output. Only used with lowpass filter and when display is not overlay and input pixel formats are not RGB.

        **fitmode, fm**

            Set sample aspect ratio of video output frames. Can be used to configure waveform so it is not streched too much in one of directions. ‘none’ Set sample aspect ration to 1/1. ‘size’ Set sample aspect ratio to match input size of video Default is ‘none’.

        **input**

            Set input formats for filter to pick from. Can be ‘all’, for selecting from all available formats, or ‘first’, for selecting first available format. Default is ‘first’.



        Parameters:

        ### 12.18 xfade_opencl

        Cross fade two videos with custom transition effect by using OpenCL.

        It accepts the following options:

        **transition**

            Set one of possible transition effects. custom Select custom transition effect, the actual transition description will be picked from source and kernel options. fade wipeleft wiperight wipeup wipedown slideleft slideright slideup slidedown Default transition is fade.

        **source**

            OpenCL program source file for custom transition.

        **kernel**

            Set name of kernel to use for custom transition from program source file.

        **duration**

            Set duration of video transition.

        **offset**

            Set time of start of transition relative to first video.

        The program source file must contain a kernel function with the given name,
        which will be run once for each plane of the output. Each run on a plane gets
        enqueued as a separate 2D global NDRange with one work-item for each pixel to
        be generated. The global ID offset for each work-item is therefore the
        coordinates of a pixel in the destination image.

        The kernel function needs to take the following arguments:

          * Destination image, __write_only image2d_t.

        This image will become the output; the kernel should write all of it.

          * First Source image, __read_only image2d_t. Second Source image, __read_only image2d_t.

        These are the most recent images on each input. The kernel may read from them
        to generate the output, but they can’t be written to.

          * Transition progress, float. This value is always between 0 and 1 inclusive.

        Example programs:

          * Apply dots curtain transition effect:

                __kernel void blend_images(__write_only image2d_t dst,
                                       __read_only  image2d_t src1,
                                       __read_only  image2d_t src2,
                                       float progress)
            {

                                           CLK_FILTER_LINEAR);
                int2  p = (int2)(get_global_id(0), get_global_id(1));
                float2 rp = (float2)(get_global_id(0), get_global_id(1));
                float2 dim = (float2)(get_image_dim(src1).x, get_image_dim(src1).y);
                rp = rp / dim;

                float2 dots = (float2)(20.0, 20.0);
                float2 center = (float2)(0,0);
                float2 unused;

                float4 val1 = read_imagef(src1, sampler, p);
                float4 val2 = read_imagef(src2, sampler, p);
                bool next = distance(fract(rp * dots, &unused), (float2)(0.5, 0.5)) < (progress / distance(rp, center));

                write_imagef(dst, p, next ? val1 : val2);

        ### 18.34 zmq, azmq

        Receive commands sent through a libzmq client, and forward them to filters in
        the filtergraph.

        `zmq` and `azmq` work as a pass-through filters. `zmq` must be inserted
        between two video filters, `azmq` between two audio filters. Both are capable
        to send messages to any filter type.

        To enable these filters you need to install the libzmq library and headers and
        configure FFmpeg with `--enable-libzmq`.

        For more information about libzmq see: <http://www.zeromq.org/>

        The `zmq` and `azmq` filters work as a libzmq server, which receives messages
        sent through a network interface defined by the bind_address (or the
        abbreviation "b") option. Default value of this option is
        tcp://localhost:5555. You may want to alter this value to your needs, but do
        not forget to escape any ’:’ signs (see filtergraph escaping).

        The received message must be in the form:



            TARGET COMMAND [ARG]


        TARGET specifies the target of the command, usually the name of the filter
        class or a specific filter instance name. The default filter instance name
        uses the pattern ‘Parsed_<filter_name>_<index>’, but you can override this by
        using the ‘filter_name@id’ syntax (see Filtergraph syntax).

        COMMAND specifies the name of the command for the target filter.

        ARG is optional and specifies the optional argument list for the given
        COMMAND.

        Upon reception, the message is processed and the corresponding command is
        injected into the filtergraph. Depending on the result, the filter will send a
        reply to the client, adopting the format:



            ERROR_CODE ERROR_REASON
            MESSAGE


        MESSAGE is optional.

        Apply Zoom & Pan effect.

        This filter accepts the following options:

        **zoom, z**

            Set the zoom expression. Range is 1-10. Default is 1.

        **x**

        **y**

            Set the x and y expression. Default is 0.

        **d**

            Set the duration expression in number of frames. This sets for how many number of frames effect will last for single input image. Default is 90.

        **s**

            Set the output image size, default is ’hd720’.

        **fps**

            Set the output frame rate, default is ’25’.

        Each expression can contain the following constants:

        **in_w, iw**

            Input width.

        **in_h, ih**

            Input height.

        **out_w, ow**

            Output width.

        **out_h, oh**

            Output height.

        **in**

            Input frame count.

        **on**

            Output frame count.

        **in_time, it**

            The input timestamp expressed in seconds. It’s NAN if the input timestamp is unknown.

        **out_time, time, ot**

            The output timestamp expressed in seconds.

        **x**

        **y**

            Last calculated ’x’ and ’y’ position from ’x’ and ’y’ expression for current input frame.

        **px**

        **py**

            ’x’ and ’y’ of last output frame of previous input frame or 0 when there was not yet such frame (first input frame).

        **zoom**

            Last calculated zoom from ’z’ expression for current input frame.

        **pzoom**

            Last calculated zoom of last output frame of previous input frame.

        **duration**

            Number of output frames for current input frame. Calculated from ’d’ expression for each input frame.

        **pduration**

            number of output frames created for previous input frame

        **a**

            Rational number: input width / input height

        **sar**

            sample aspect ratio

        **dar**

            display aspect ratio

        ### 11.295 zscale

        Scale (resize) the input video, using the z.lib library:
        <https://github.com/sekrit-twc/zimg>. To enable compilation of this filter,
        you need to configure FFmpeg with `--enable-libzimg`.

        The zscale filter forces the output display aspect ratio to be the same as the
        input, by changing the output sample aspect ratio.

        If the input image format is different from the format requested by the next
        filter, the zscale filter will convert the input to the requested format.
