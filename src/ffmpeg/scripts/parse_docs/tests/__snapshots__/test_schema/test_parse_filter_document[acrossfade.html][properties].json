At the end of the cross fade effect the first input audio will be completely silent. Default is 44100. \n\n**duration, d**\n\n    Specify the duration of the cross fade effect. See (ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual for the accepted syntax. By default the duration is determined by nb_samples. If set this option is used instead of nb_samples. \n\n**overlap, o**\n\n    Should first stream end overlap with second stream start. Default is enabled. \n\n**curve1**\n\n    Set curve for cross fade transition for first stream. \n\n**curve2**\n\n    Set curve for cross fade transition for second stream.
