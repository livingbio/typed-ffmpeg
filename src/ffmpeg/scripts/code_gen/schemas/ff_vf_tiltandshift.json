  "description": "### 11.256 tiltandshift\n\nWhat happens when you invert time and space?\n\nNormally a video is composed of several frames that represent a different\ninstant of time and shows a scence that evolves in the space captured by the\nframe. This filter is the antipode of that concept, taking inspiration by tilt\nand shift photography.\n\nA filtered frame contains the whole timeline of events composing the sequence,\nand this is obtained by placing a slice of pixels from each frame into a\nsingle one. However, since there are no infinite-width frames, this is done up\nthe width of the input frame, and a video is recomposed by shifting away one\ncolumn for each subsequent frame. In order to map space to time, the filter\ntilts each input frame as well, so that motion is preseved. This is\naccomplished by progressively selecting a different column from each input\nframe.\n\nThe end result is a sort of inverted parralax, so that far away objects move\nmuch faster that the ones in the front. The ideal conditions for this video\neffect are when there is either very little motion and the backgroud is\nstatic, or when there is a lot of motion and a very wide depth of field (eg.\nwide panorama, while moving on a train).\n\nThe filter accepts the following parameters:\n\n**tilt**\n\n    Tilt video while shifting (default). When unset, video will be sliding a static image, composed of the first column of each frame. \n\n**start**\n\n    What to do at the start of filtering (see below). \n\n**end**\n\n    What to do at the end of filtering (see below). \n\n**hold**\n\n    How many columns should pass through before start of filtering. \n\n**pad**\n\n    How many columns should be inserted before end of filtering. \n\nNormally the filter shifts and tils from the very first frame, and stops when\nthe last one is received. However, before filtering starts, normal video may\nbe preseved, so that the effect is slowly shifted in its place. Similarly, the\nlast video frame may be reconstructed at the end. Alternatively it is possible\nto just start and end with black.\n\n**\u2018none\u2019**\n\n    Filtering is starts immediately and ends when the last frame is received. \n\n**\u2018frame\u2019**\n\n    The first frames or the very last frame are kept intact during processing. \n\n**\u2018black\u2019**\n\n    Black is padded at the beginning or at the end of filtering. \n\n",
