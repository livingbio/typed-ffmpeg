        8.2 acompressor A compressor is mainly used to reduce the dynamic range of a signal. Especially modern music is mostly compressed at a high ratio to improve the overall loudness. Itâ€™s done to get the highest attention of a listener, "fatten" the sound and bring more "power" to the track. If a signal is compressed too much it may sound dull or "dead" afterwards or it may start to "pump" (which could be a powerful effect but can also destroy a track completely). The right compression is the key to reach a professional sound and is the high art of mixing and mastering. Because of its complex settings it may take a long time to get the right feeling for this kind of effect. Compression is done by detecting the volume above a chosen level threshold and dividing it by the factor set with ratio. So if you set the threshold to -12dB and your signal reaches -6dB a ratio of 2:1 will result in a signal at -9dB. Because an exact manipulation of the signal would cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be levelled over the time. This is done by setting "Attack" and "Release". attack determines how long the signal has to rise above the threshold before any reduction will occur and release sets the time the signal has to fall below the threshold to reduce the reduction again. Shorter signals than the chosen attack time will be left untouched. The overall reduction of the signal can be made up afterwards with the makeup setting. So compressing the peaks of a signal about 6dB and raising the makeup to this level results in a signal twice as loud than the source. To gain a softer entry in the compression the knee flattens the hard edge at the threshold in the range of the chosen decibels. The filter accepts the following options:

        Parameters:
        ----------
        level_in:
            Set input gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625 and 64.
        mode:
            Set mode of compressor operation. Can be upward or downward. Default is downward.
        threshold:
            If a signal of stream rises above this level it will affect the gain reduction. By default it is 0.125. Range is between 0.00097563 and 1.
        ratio:
            Set a ratio by which the signal is reduced. 1:2 means that if the level rose 4dB above the threshold, it will be only 2dB above after the reduction. Default is 2. Range is between 1 and 20.
        attack:
            Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain reduction starts. Default is 20. Range is between 0.01 and 2000.
        release:
            Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before reduction is decreased again. Default is 250. Range is between 0.01 and 9000.
        makeup:
            Set the amount by how much signal will be amplified after processing. Default is 1. Range is from 1 to 64.
        knee:
            Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly. Default is 2.82843. Range is between 1 and 8.
        link:
            Choose if the average level between all channels of input stream or the louder(maximum) channel of input stream affects the reduction. Default is average.
        detection:
            Should the exact signal be taken in case of peak or an RMS one in case of rms. Default is rms which is mostly smoother.
        mix:
            How much to use compressed signal in output. Default is 1. Range is between 0 and 1.

This doesnâ€™t change the bit depth at all, it just produces the effect. Material reduced in bit depth sounds more harsh and "digital". This filter is able to even round to continuous values instead of discrete bit depths. Additionally it has a D/C offset which results in different crushing of the lower and the upper half of the signal. An Anti-Aliasing setting is able to produce "softer" crushing sounds. Another feature of this filter is the logarithmic mode. This setting switches from linear distances between bits to logarithmic ones. The result is a much more "natural" sounding crusher which doesnâ€™t gate low signals for example. The human ear has a logarithmic perception, so this kind of crushing is much more pleasant. Logarithmic crushing is also able to get anti-aliased. The filter accepts the following options:

        qoffset:
            Quantisation offset to apply within the region. This must be a real value in the range -1 to +1. A value of zero indicates no quality change. A negative value asks for better quality (less quantisation), while a positive value asks for worse quality (greater quantisation). The range is calibrated so that the extreme values indicate the largest possible offset - if the rest of the frame is encoded with the worst possible quality, an offset of -1 indicates that this region should be encoded with the best possible quality anyway. Intermediate values are then interpolated in some codec-dependent way. For example, in 10-bit H.264 the quantisation parameter varies between -12 and 51. A typical qoffset value of -1/10 therefore indicates that this region should be encoded with a QP around one-tenth of the full range better than the rest of the frame. So, if most of the frame were to be encoded with a QP of around 30, this region would get a QP of around 24 (an offset of approximately -1/10 * (51 - -12) = -6.3). An extreme value of -1 would indicate that this region should be encoded with the best possible quality regardless of the treatment of the rest of the frame - that is, should be encoded at a QP of -12.
        clear:
            If set to true, remove any existing regions of interest marked on the frame before adding the new one.

        8.29 agate A gate is mainly used to reduce lower parts of a signal. This kind of signal processing reduces disturbing noise between useful signals. Gating is done by detecting the volume below a chosen level threshold and dividing it by the factor set with ratio. The bottom of the noise floor is set via range. Because an exact manipulation of the signal would cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be levelled over time. This is done by setting attack and release. attack determines how long the signal has to fall below the threshold before any reduction will occur and release sets the time the signal has to rise above the threshold to reduce the reduction again. Shorter signals than the chosen attack time will be left untouched.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        level_in:
            Set input level before filtering. Default is 1. Allowed range is from 0.015625 to 64.
        mode:
            Set the mode of operation. Can be upward or downward. Default is downward. If set to upward mode, higher parts of signal will be amplified, expanding dynamic range in upward direction. Otherwise, in case of downward lower parts of signal will be reduced.
        range:
            Set the level of gain reduction when the signal is below the threshold. Default is 0.06125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1. Setting this to 0 disables reduction and then filter behaves like expander.
        threshold:
            If a signal rises above this level the gain reduction is released. Default is 0.125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.
        ratio:
            Set a ratio by which the signal is reduced. Default is 2. Allowed range is from 1 to 9000.
        attack:
            Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain reduction stops. Default is 20 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.
        release:
            Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before the reduction is increased again. Default is 250 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.
        makeup:
            Set amount of amplification of signal after processing. Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 64.
        knee:
            Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly. Default is 2.828427125. Allowed range is from 1 to 8.
        detection:
            Choose if exact signal should be taken for detection or an RMS like one. Default is rms. Can be peak or rms.
        link:
            Choose if the average level between all channels or the louder channel affects the reduction. Default is average. Can be average or maximum.

        8.31 alimiter The limiter prevents an input signal from rising over a desired threshold. This limiter uses lookahead technology to prevent your signal from distorting. It means that there is a small delay after the signal is processed. Keep in mind that the delay it produces is the attack time you set. The filter accepts the following options: Depending on picked setting it is recommended to upsample input 2x or 4x times with aresample before applying this filter.

        release:
            Come back from limiting to attenuation 1.0 in this amount of milliseconds. Default is 50 milliseconds.
        asc:
            When gain reduction is always needed ASC takes care of releasing to an average reduction level rather than reaching a reduction of 0 in the release time.
        asc_level:
            Select how much the release time is affected by ASC, 0 means nearly no changes in release time while 1 produces higher release times.
        level:
            Auto level output signal. Default is enabled. This normalizes audio back to 0dB if enabled.
        latency:
            Compensate the delay introduced by using the lookahead buffer set with attack parameter. Also flush the valid audio data in the lookahead buffer when the stream hits EOF.

If the channel layouts of the inputs are not disjoint, the output will have all the channels of the first input then all the channels of the second input, in that order, and the channel layout of the output will be the default value corresponding to the total number of channels. For example, if the first input is in 2.1 (FL+FR+LF) and the second input is FC+BL+BR, then the output will be in 5.1, with the channels in the following order: a1, a2, b1, a3, b2, b3 (a1 is the first channel of the first input, b1 is the first channel of the second input). On the other hand, if both input are in stereo, the output channels will be in the default order: a1, a2, b1, b2, and the channel layout will be arbitrarily set to 4.0, which may or may not be the expected value.

        8.46 apulsator Audio pulsator is something between an autopanner and a tremolo. But it can produce funny stereo effects as well. Pulsator changes the volume of the left and right channel based on a LFO (low frequency oscillator) with different waveforms and shifted phases. This filter have the ability to define an offset between left and right channel. An offset of 0 means that both LFO shapes match each other. The left and right channel are altered equally - a conventional tremolo. An offset of 50% means that the shape of the right channel is exactly shifted in phase (or moved backwards about half of the frequency) - pulsator acts as an autopanner. At 1 both curves match again. Every setting in between moves the phase shift gapless between all stages and produces some "bypassing" sounds with sine and triangle waveforms. The more you set the offset near 1 (starting from the 0.5) the faster the signal passes from the left to the right speaker. The filter accepts the following options:

        Parameters:
        ----------
        level_in:

        mode:
            Set waveform shape the LFO will use. Can be one of: sine, triangle, square, sawup or sawdown. Default is sine.
        amount:
            Set modulation. Define how much of original signal is affected by the LFO.
        offset_l:
            Set left channel offset. Default is 0. Allowed range is [0 - 1].
        offset_r:
            Set right channel offset. Default is 0.5. Allowed range is [0 - 1].
        width:
            Set pulse width. Default is 1. Allowed range is [0 - 2].
        timing:
            Set possible timing mode. Can be one of: bpm, ms or hz. Default is hz.
        bpm:
            Set bpm. Default is 120. Allowed range is [30 - 300]. Only used if timing is set to bpm.
        ms:

        8.67 atrim Trim the input so that the output contains one continuous subpart of the input. It accepts the following parameters: start, end, and duration are expressed as time duration specifications; see (ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual. Note that the first two sets of the start/end options and the duration option look at the frame timestamp, while the _sample options simply count the samples that pass through the filter. So start/end_pts and start/end_sample will give different results when the timestamps are wrong, inexact or do not start at zero. Also note that this filter does not modify the timestamps. If you wish to have the output timestamps start at zero, insert the asetpts filter after the atrim filter. If multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries to be greedy and keep all samples that match at least one of the specified constraints. To keep only the part that matches all the constraints at once, chain multiple atrim filters. The defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is possible to set e.g. just the end values to keep everything before the specified time. Examples: Drop everything except the second minute of input: ffmpeg -i INPUT -af atrim=60:120 Keep only the first 1000 samples: ffmpeg -i INPUT -af atrim=end_sample=1000

        Parameters:
        ----------
        start:
            Timestamp (in seconds) of the start of the section to keep. I.e. the audio sample with the timestamp start will be the first sample in the output.
        end:
            Specify time of the first audio sample that will be dropped, i.e. the audio sample immediately preceding the one with the timestamp end will be the last sample in the output.
        start_pts:
            Same as start, except this option sets the start timestamp in samples instead of seconds.
        end_pts:
            Same as end, except this option sets the end timestamp in samples instead of seconds.
        duration:

        8.71 bass, lowshelf Boost or cut the bass (lower) frequencies of the audio using a two-pole shelving filter with a response similar to that of a standard hi-fiâ€™s tone-controls. This is also known as shelving equalisation (EQ). The filter accepts the following options:

        Parameters:
        ----------
        gain:
            Give the gain at 0 Hz. Its useful range is about -20 (for a large cut) to +20 (for a large boost). Beware of clipping when using a positive gain.
        frequency:
            Set the filterâ€™s central frequency and so can be used to extend or reduce the frequency range to be boosted or cut. The default value is 100 Hz.
        width_type:
            Set method to specify band-width of filter. h Hz q Q-Factor o octave s slope k kHz
        width:
            Determine how steep is the filterâ€™s shelf transition.
        poles:
            Set number of poles. Default is 2.
        mix:
            How much to use filtered signal in output. Default is 1. Range is between 0 and 1.
        channels:
            Specify which channels to filter, by default all available are filtered.
        normalize:
            Normalize biquad coefficients, by default is disabled. Enabling it will normalize magnitude response at DC to 0dB.
        transform:
            Set transform type of IIR filter. di dii tdi tdii latt svf zdf
        precision:
            Set precision of filtering. auto Pick automatic sample format depending on surround filters. s16 Always use signed 16-bit. s32 Always use signed 32-bit. f32 Always use float 32-bit. f64 Always use float 64-bit.
        block_size:
            Set block size used for reverse IIR processing. If this value is set to high enough value (higher than impulse response length truncated when reaches near zero values) filtering will become linear phase otherwise if not big enough it will just produce nasty artifacts. Note that filter delay will be exactly this many samples when set to non-zero value.

The filter outputs its detection analysis to both the log as well as frame metadata. If a black segment of at least the specified minimum duration is found, a line with the start and end timestamps as well as duration is printed to the log with level info. In addition, a log line with level debug is printed per frame showing the black amount detected for that frame. The filter also attaches metadata to the first frame of a black segment with key lavfi.black_start and to the first frame after the black segment ends with key lavfi.black_end. The value is the frameâ€™s timestamp. This metadata is added regardless of the minimum duration specified.

        block_pct:
            Determine blurriness only for the most significant blocks, given in percentage.
        block_width:
            Determine blurriness for blocks of width block_width. If set to any value smaller 1, no blocks are used and the whole image is processed as one no matter of block_height.
        block_height:

            Set denoising strength. Default value is 1. Allowed range is from 0 to 999.9. The denoising algorithm is very sensitive to sigma, so adjust it according to the source.
        block:
            Set local patch size. This sets dimensions in 2D.
        bstep:
            Set sliding step for processing blocks. Default value is 4. Allowed range is from 1 to 64. Smaller values allows processing more reference blocks and is slower.
        group:
            Set maximal number of similar blocks for 3rd dimension. Default value is 1. When set to 1, no block matching is done. Larger values allows more blocks in single group. Allowed range is from 1 to 256.

            Set radius for search block matching. Default is 9. Allowed range is from 1 to INT32_MAX.
        mstep:
            Set step between two search locations for block matching. Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 64. Smaller is slower.
        thmse:
            Set threshold of mean square error for block matching. Valid range is 0 to INT32_MAX.
        hdthr:
            Set thresholding parameter for hard thresholding in 3D transformed domain. Larger values results in stronger hard-thresholding filtering in frequency domain.
        estim:
            Set filtering estimation mode. Can be basic or final. Default is basic.
        ref:
            If enabled, filter will use 2nd stream for block matching. Default is disabled for basic value of estim option, and always enabled if value of estim is final.

            A list of times in seconds for each channel over which the instantaneous level of the input signal is averaged to determine its volume. attacks refers to increase of volume and decays refers to decrease of volume. For most situations, the attack time (response to the audio getting louder) should be shorter than the decay time, because the human ear is more sensitive to sudden loud audio than sudden soft audio. A typical value for attack is 0.3 seconds and a typical value for decay is 0.8 seconds. If specified number of attacks & decays is lower than number of channels, the last set attack/decay will be used for all remaining channels.
        decays:
            A list of times in seconds for each channel over which the instantaneous level of the input signal is averaged to determine its volume. attacks refers to increase of volume and decays refers to decrease of volume. For most situations, the attack time (response to the audio getting louder) should be shorter than the decay time, because the human ear is more sensitive to sudden loud audio than sudden soft audio. A typical value for attack is 0.3 seconds and a typical value for decay is 0.8 seconds. If specified number of attacks & decays is lower than number of channels, the last set attack/decay will be used for all remaining channels.
        points:
            A list of points for the transfer function, specified in dB relative to the maximum possible signal amplitude. Each key points list must be defined using the following syntax: x0/y0|x1/y1|x2/y2|.... or x0/y0 x1/y1 x2/y2 .... The input values must be in strictly increasing order but the transfer function does not have to be monotonically rising. The point 0/0 is assumed but may be overridden (by 0/out-dBn). Typical values for the transfer function are -70/-70|-60/-20|1/0.
        soft_knee:
            Set the curve radius in dB for all joints. It defaults to 0.01.
        gain:
            Set the additional gain in dB to be applied at all points on the transfer function. This allows for easy adjustment of the overall gain. It defaults to 0.
        volume:
            Set an initial volume, in dB, to be assumed for each channel when filtering starts. This permits the user to supply a nominal level initially, so that, for example, a very large gain is not applied to initial signal levels before the companding has begun to operate. A typical value for audio which is initially quiet is -90 dB. It defaults to 0.
        delay:
            Set a delay, in seconds. The input audio is analyzed immediately, but audio is delayed before being fed to the volume adjuster. Specifying a delay approximately equal to the attack/decay times allows the filter to effectively operate in predictive rather than reactive mode. It defaults to 0.

        8.78 compensationdelay Compensation Delay Line is a metric based delay to compensate differing positions of microphones or speakers. For example, you have recorded guitar with two microphones placed in different locations. Because the front of sound wave has fixed speed in normal conditions, the phasing of microphones can vary and depends on their location and interposition. The best sound mix can be achieved when these microphones are in phase (synchronized). Note that a distance of ~30 cm between microphones makes one microphone capture the signal in antiphase to the other microphone. That makes the final mix sound moody. This filter helps to solve phasing problems by adding different delays to each microphone track and make them synchronized. The best result can be reached when you take one track as base and synchronize other tracks one by one with it. Remember that synchronization/delay tolerance depends on sample rate, too. Higher sample rates will give more tolerance. The filter accepts the following parameters:

        Parameters:
        ----------
        mm:
            Set millimeters distance. This is compensation distance for fine tuning. Default is 0.

        11.47 coreimage Video filtering on GPU using Appleâ€™s CoreImage API on OSX. Hardware acceleration is based on an OpenGL context. Usually, this means it is processed by video hardware. However, software-based OpenGL implementations exist which means there is no guarantee for hardware processing. It depends on the respective OSX. There are many filters and image generators provided by Apple that come with a large variety of options. The filter has to be referenced by its name along with its options. The coreimage filter accepts the following options: Several filters can be chained for successive processing without GPU-HOST transfers allowing for fast processing of complex filter chains. Currently, only filters with zero (generators) or exactly one (filters) input image and one output image are supported. Also, transition filters are not yet usable as intended. Some filters generate output images with additional padding depending on the respective filter kernel. The padding is automatically removed to ensure the filter output has the same size as the input image. For image generators, the size of the output image is determined by the previous output image of the filter chain or the input image of the whole filterchain, respectively. The generators do not use the pixel information of this image to generate their output. However, the generated output is blended onto this image, resulting in partial or complete coverage of the output image. The coreimagesrc video source can be used for generating input images which are directly fed into the filter chain. By using it, providing input images by another video source or an input video is not required.

            Specify all filters by their respective name and options. Use list_filters to determine all valid filter names and options. Numerical options are specified by a float value and are automatically clamped to their respective value range. Vector and color options have to be specified by a list of space separated float values. Character escaping has to be done. A special option name default is available to use default options for a filter. It is required to specify either default or at least one of the filter options. All omitted options are used with their default values. The syntax of the filter string is as follows: filter=<NAME>@<OPTION>=<VALUE>[@<OPTION>=<VALUE>][@...][#<NAME>@<OPTION>=<VALUE>[@<OPTION>=<VALUE>][@...]][#...]
        output_rect:
            Specify a rectangle where the output of the filter chain is copied into the input image. It is given by a list of space separated float values: output_rect=x\ y\ width\ height If not given, the output rectangle equals the dimensions of the input image.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        mode:
            Depending on mode crop detection is based on either the mere black value of surrounding pixels or a combination of motion vectors and edge pixels. â€˜blackâ€™ Detect black pixels surrounding the playing video. For fine control use option limit. â€˜mvedgesâ€™ Detect the playing video by the motion vectors inside the video and scanning for edge pixels typically forming the border of a playing video.
        limit:
            Set higher black value threshold, which can be optionally specified from nothing (0) to everything (255 for 8-bit based formats). An intensity value greater to the set value is considered non-black. It defaults to 24. You can also specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0 which will be scaled depending on the bitdepth of the pixel format.
        round:
            The value which the width/height should be divisible by. It defaults to 16. The offset is automatically adjusted to center the video. Use 2 to get only even dimensions (needed for 4:2:2 video). 16 is best when encoding to most video codecs.
        skip:
            Set the number of initial frames for which evaluation is skipped. Default is 2. Range is 0 to INT_MAX.
        reset_count:
            Set the counter that determines after how many frames cropdetect will reset the previously detected largest video area and start over to detect the current optimal crop area. Default value is 0. This can be useful when channel logos distort the video area. 0 indicates â€™never resetâ€™, and returns the largest area encountered during playback.
        mv_threshold:
            Set motion in pixel units as threshold for motion detection. It defaults to 8.
        low:
            Set low and high threshold values used by the Canny thresholding algorithm. The high threshold selects the "strong" edge pixels, which are then connected through 8-connectivity with the "weak" edge pixels selected by the low threshold. low and high threshold values must be chosen in the range [0,1], and low should be lesser or equal to high. Default value for low is 5/255, and default value for high is 15/255.
        high:
            Set low and high threshold values used by the Canny thresholding algorithm.

        11.53 curves Apply color adjustments using curves. This filter is similar to the Adobe Photoshop and GIMP curves tools. Each component (red, green and blue) has its values defined by N key points tied from each other using a smooth curve. The x-axis represents the pixel values from the input frame, and the y-axis the new pixel values to be set for the output frame. By default, a component curve is defined by the two points (0;0) and (1;1). This creates a straight line where each original pixel value is "adjusted" to its own value, which means no change to the image. The filter allows you to redefine these two points and add some more. A new curve will be define to pass smoothly through all these new coordinates. The new defined points needs to be strictly increasing over the x-axis, and their x and y values must be in the [0;1] interval. The curve is formed by using a natural or monotonic cubic spline interpolation, depending on the interp option (default: natural). The natural spline produces a smoother curve in general while the monotonic (pchip) spline guarantees the transitions between the specified points to be monotonic. If the computed curves happened to go outside the vector spaces, the values will be clipped accordingly. The filter accepts the following options: To avoid some filtergraph syntax conflicts, each key points list need to be defined using the following syntax: x0/y0 x1/y1 x2/y2 ....

            Select one of the available color presets. This option can be used in addition to the r, g, b parameters; in this case, the later options takes priority on the preset values. Available presets are: â€˜noneâ€™ â€˜color_negativeâ€™ â€˜cross_processâ€™ â€˜darkerâ€™ â€˜increase_contrastâ€™ â€˜lighterâ€™ â€˜linear_contrastâ€™ â€˜medium_contrastâ€™ â€˜negativeâ€™ â€˜strong_contrastâ€™ â€˜vintageâ€™ Default is none.
        master:
            Set the master key points. These points will define a second pass mapping. It is sometimes called a "luminance" or "value" mapping. It can be used with r, g, b or all since it acts like a post-processing LUT.
        red:
            Set the key points for the red component.
        green:
            Set the key points for the green component.
        blue:
            Set the key points for the blue component.
        all:
            Set the key points for all components (not including master). Can be used in addition to the other key points component options. In this case, the unset component(s) will fallback on this all setting.
        psfile:
            Specify a Photoshop curves file (.acv) to import the settings from.
        plot:
            Save Gnuplot script of the curves in specified file.
        interp:
            Specify the kind of interpolation. Available algorithms are: â€˜naturalâ€™ Natural cubic spline using a piece-wise cubic polynomial that is twice continuously differentiable. â€˜pchipâ€™ Monotonic cubic spline using a piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial (PCHIP).

        11.56 dctdnoiz Denoise frames using 2D DCT (frequency domain filtering). This filter is not designed for real time. The filter accepts the following options:

        Parameters:
        ----------
        sigma:
            Set the noise sigma constant. This sigma defines a hard threshold of 3 * sigma; every DCT coefficient (absolute value) below this threshold with be dropped. If you need a more advanced filtering, see expr. Default is 0.
        overlap:
            Set number overlapping pixels for each block. Since the filter can be slow, you may want to reduce this value, at the cost of a less effective filter and the risk of various artefacts. If the overlapping value doesnâ€™t permit processing the whole input width or height, a warning will be displayed and according borders wonâ€™t be denoised. Default value is blocksize-1, which is the best possible setting.
        expr:
            Set the coefficient factor expression. For each coefficient of a DCT block, this expression will be evaluated as a multiplier value for the coefficient. If this is option is set, the sigma option will be ignored. The absolute value of the coefficient can be accessed through the c variable.
        n:
            Set the blocksize using the number of bits. 1<<n defines the blocksize, which is the width and height of the processed blocks. The default value is 3 (8x8) and can be raised to 4 for a blocksize of 16x16. Note that changing this setting has huge consequences on the speed processing. Also, a larger block size does not necessarily means a better de-noising.

        range:
            Banding detection range in pixels. Default is 16. If positive, random number in range 0 to set value will be used. If negative, exact absolute value will be used. The range defines square of four pixels around current pixel.
        direction:
            Set direction in radians from which four pixel will be compared. If positive, random direction from 0 to set direction will be picked. If negative, exact of absolute value will be picked. For example direction 0, -PI or -2*PI radians will pick only pixels on same row and -PI/2 will pick only pixels on same column.
        blur:
            If enabled, current pixel is compared with average value of all four surrounding pixels. The default is enabled. If disabled current pixel is compared with all four surrounding pixels. The pixel is considered banded if only all four differences with surrounding pixels are less than threshold.
        coupling:
            If enabled, current pixel is changed if and only if all pixel components are banded, e.g. banding detection threshold is triggered for all color components. The default is disabled.

        8.85 dynaudnorm Dynamic Audio Normalizer. This filter applies a certain amount of gain to the input audio in order to bring its peak magnitude to a target level (e.g. 0 dBFS). However, in contrast to more "simple" normalization algorithms, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer *dynamically* re-adjusts the gain factor to the input audio. This allows for applying extra gain to the "quiet" sections of the audio while avoiding distortions or clipping the "loud" sections. In other words: The Dynamic Audio Normalizer will "even out" the volume of quiet and loud sections, in the sense that the volume of each section is brought to the same target level. Note, however, that the Dynamic Audio Normalizer achieves this goal *without* applying "dynamic range compressing". It will retain 100% of the dynamic range *within* each section of the audio file.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        framelen:
            Set the frame length in milliseconds. In range from 10 to 8000 milliseconds. Default is 500 milliseconds. The Dynamic Audio Normalizer processes the input audio in small chunks, referred to as frames. This is required, because a peak magnitude has no meaning for just a single sample value. Instead, we need to determine the peak magnitude for a contiguous sequence of sample values. While a "standard" normalizer would simply use the peak magnitude of the complete file, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer determines the peak magnitude individually for each frame. The length of a frame is specified in milliseconds. By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer uses a frame length of 500 milliseconds, which has been found to give good results with most files. Note that the exact frame length, in number of samples, will be determined automatically, based on the sampling rate of the individual input audio file.
        gausssize:
            Set the Gaussian filter window size. In range from 3 to 301, must be odd number. Default is 31. Probably the most important parameter of the Dynamic Audio Normalizer is the window size of the Gaussian smoothing filter. The filterâ€™s window size is specified in frames, centered around the current frame. For the sake of simplicity, this must be an odd number. Consequently, the default value of 31 takes into account the current frame, as well as the 15 preceding frames and the 15 subsequent frames. Using a larger window results in a stronger smoothing effect and thus in less gain variation, i.e. slower gain adaptation. Conversely, using a smaller window results in a weaker smoothing effect and thus in more gain variation, i.e. faster gain adaptation. In other words, the more you increase this value, the more the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will behave like a "traditional" normalization filter. On the contrary, the more you decrease this value, the more the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will behave like a dynamic range compressor.
        peak:
            Set the target peak value. This specifies the highest permissible magnitude level for the normalized audio input. This filter will try to approach the target peak magnitude as closely as possible, but at the same time it also makes sure that the normalized signal will never exceed the peak magnitude. A frameâ€™s maximum local gain factor is imposed directly by the target peak magnitude. The default value is 0.95 and thus leaves a headroom of 5%*. It is not recommended to go above this value.
        maxgain:
            Set the maximum gain factor. In range from 1.0 to 100.0. Default is 10.0. The Dynamic Audio Normalizer determines the maximum possible (local) gain factor for each input frame, i.e. the maximum gain factor that does not result in clipping or distortion. The maximum gain factor is determined by the frameâ€™s highest magnitude sample. However, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer additionally bounds the frameâ€™s maximum gain factor by a predetermined (global) maximum gain factor. This is done in order to avoid excessive gain factors in "silent" or almost silent frames. By default, the maximum gain factor is 10.0, For most inputs the default value should be sufficient and it usually is not recommended to increase this value. Though, for input with an extremely low overall volume level, it may be necessary to allow even higher gain factors. Note, however, that the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does not simply apply a "hard" threshold (i.e. cut off values above the threshold). Instead, a "sigmoid" threshold function will be applied. This way, the gain factors will smoothly approach the threshold value, but never exceed that value.
        targetrms:
            Set the target RMS. In range from 0.0 to 1.0. Default is 0.0 - disabled. By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer performs "peak" normalization. This means that the maximum local gain factor for each frame is defined (only) by the frameâ€™s highest magnitude sample. This way, the samples can be amplified as much as possible without exceeding the maximum signal level, i.e. without clipping. Optionally, however, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer can also take into account the frameâ€™s root mean square, abbreviated RMS. In electrical engineering, the RMS is commonly used to determine the power of a time-varying signal. It is therefore considered that the RMS is a better approximation of the "perceived loudness" than just looking at the signalâ€™s peak magnitude. Consequently, by adjusting all frames to a constant RMS value, a uniform "perceived loudness" can be established. If a target RMS value has been specified, a frameâ€™s local gain factor is defined as the factor that would result in exactly that RMS value. Note, however, that the maximum local gain factor is still restricted by the frameâ€™s highest magnitude sample, in order to prevent clipping.
        coupling:
            Enable channels coupling. By default is enabled. By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will amplify all channels by the same amount. This means the same gain factor will be applied to all channels, i.e. the maximum possible gain factor is determined by the "loudest" channel. However, in some recordings, it may happen that the volume of the different channels is uneven, e.g. one channel may be "quieter" than the other one(s). In this case, this option can be used to disable the channel coupling. This way, the gain factor will be determined independently for each channel, depending only on the individual channelâ€™s highest magnitude sample. This allows for harmonizing the volume of the different channels.
        correctdc:
            Enable DC bias correction. By default is disabled. An audio signal (in the time domain) is a sequence of sample values. In the Dynamic Audio Normalizer these sample values are represented in the -1.0 to 1.0 range, regardless of the original input format. Normally, the audio signal, or "waveform", should be centered around the zero point. That means if we calculate the mean value of all samples in a file, or in a single frame, then the result should be 0.0 or at least very close to that value. If, however, there is a significant deviation of the mean value from 0.0, in either positive or negative direction, this is referred to as a DC bias or DC offset. Since a DC bias is clearly undesirable, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer provides optional DC bias correction. With DC bias correction enabled, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will determine the mean value, or "DC correction" offset, of each input frame and subtract that value from all of the frameâ€™s sample values which ensures those samples are centered around 0.0 again. Also, in order to avoid "gaps" at the frame boundaries, the DC correction offset values will be interpolated smoothly between neighbouring frames.
        altboundary:
            Enable alternative boundary mode. By default is disabled. The Dynamic Audio Normalizer takes into account a certain neighbourhood around each frame. This includes the preceding frames as well as the subsequent frames. However, for the "boundary" frames, located at the very beginning and at the very end of the audio file, not all neighbouring frames are available. In particular, for the first few frames in the audio file, the preceding frames are not known. And, similarly, for the last few frames in the audio file, the subsequent frames are not known. Thus, the question arises which gain factors should be assumed for the missing frames in the "boundary" region. The Dynamic Audio Normalizer implements two modes to deal with this situation. The default boundary mode assumes a gain factor of exactly 1.0 for the missing frames, resulting in a smooth "fade in" and "fade out" at the beginning and at the end of the input, respectively.
        compress:
            Set the compress factor. In range from 0.0 to 30.0. Default is 0.0. By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does not apply "traditional" compression. This means that signal peaks will not be pruned and thus the full dynamic range will be retained within each local neighbourhood. However, in some cases it may be desirable to combine the Dynamic Audio Normalizerâ€™s normalization algorithm with a more "traditional" compression. For this purpose, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer provides an optional compression (thresholding) function. If (and only if) the compression feature is enabled, all input frames will be processed by a soft knee thresholding function prior to the actual normalization process. Put simply, the thresholding function is going to prune all samples whose magnitude exceeds a certain threshold value. However, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does not simply apply a fixed threshold value. Instead, the threshold value will be adjusted for each individual frame. In general, smaller parameters result in stronger compression, and vice versa. Values below 3.0 are not recommended, because audible distortion may appear.
        threshold:
            Set the target threshold value. This specifies the lowest permissible magnitude level for the audio input which will be normalized. If input frame volume is above this value frame will be normalized. Otherwise frame may not be normalized at all. The default value is set to 0, which means all input frames will be normalized. This option is mostly useful if digital noise is not wanted to be amplified.
        channels:
            Specify which channels to filter, by default all available channels are filtered.
        overlap:
            Specify overlap for frames. If set to 0 (default) no frame overlapping is done. Using >0 and <1 values will make less conservative gain adjustments, like when framelen option is set to smaller value, if framelen option value is compensated for non-zero overlap then gain adjustments will be smoother across time compared to zero overlap case.
        curve:
            Specify the peak mapping curve expression which is going to be used when calculating gain applied to frames. The max output frame gain will still be limited by other options mentioned previously for this filter. The expression can contain the following constants: ch current channel number sn current sample number nb_channels number of channels t timestamp expressed in seconds sr sample rate p current frame peak value

        11.94 fieldmatch Field matching filter for inverse telecine. It is meant to reconstruct the progressive frames from a telecined stream. The filter does not drop duplicated frames, so to achieve a complete inverse telecine fieldmatch needs to be followed by a decimation filter such as decimate in the filtergraph. The separation of the field matching and the decimation is notably motivated by the possibility of inserting a de-interlacing filter fallback between the two. If the source has mixed telecined and real interlaced content, fieldmatch will not be able to match fields for the interlaced parts. But these remaining combed frames will be marked as interlaced, and thus can be de-interlaced by a later filter such as yadif before decimation. In addition to the various configuration options, fieldmatch can take an optional second stream, activated through the ppsrc option. If enabled, the frames reconstruction will be based on the fields and frames from this second stream. This allows the first input to be pre-processed in order to help the various algorithms of the filter, while keeping the output lossless (assuming the fields are matched properly). Typically, a field-aware denoiser, or brightness/contrast adjustments can help. Note that this filter uses the same algorithms as TIVTC/TFM (AviSynth project) and VIVTC/VFM (VapourSynth project). The later is a light clone of TFM from which fieldmatch is based on. While the semantic and usage are very close, some behaviour and options names can differ. The decimate filter currently only works for constant frame rate input. If your input has mixed telecined (30fps) and progressive content with a lower framerate like 24fps use the following filterchain to produce the necessary cfr stream: dejudder,fps=30000/1001,fieldmatch,decimate. The filter accepts the following options:

        Parameters:
        ----------
        order:
            Specify the assumed field order of the input stream. Available values are: â€˜autoâ€™ Auto detect parity (use FFmpegâ€™s internal parity value). â€˜bffâ€™ Assume bottom field first. â€˜tffâ€™ Assume top field first. Note that it is sometimes recommended not to trust the parity announced by the stream. Default value is auto.
        mode:
            Set the matching mode or strategy to use. pc mode is the safest in the sense that it wonâ€™t risk creating jerkiness due to duplicate frames when possible, but if there are bad edits or blended fields it will end up outputting combed frames when a good match might actually exist. On the other hand, pcn_ub mode is the most risky in terms of creating jerkiness, but will almost always find a good frame if there is one. The other values are all somewhere in between pc and pcn_ub in terms of risking jerkiness and creating duplicate frames versus finding good matches in sections with bad edits, orphaned fields, blended fields, etc. More details about p/c/n/u/b are available in p/c/n/u/b meaning section. Available values are: â€˜pcâ€™ 2-way matching (p/c) â€˜pc_nâ€™ 2-way matching, and trying 3rd match if still combed (p/c + n) â€˜pc_uâ€™ 2-way matching, and trying 3rd match (same order) if still combed (p/c + u) â€˜pc_n_ubâ€™ 2-way matching, trying 3rd match if still combed, and trying 4th/5th matches if still combed (p/c + n + u/b) â€˜pcnâ€™ 3-way matching (p/c/n) â€˜pcn_ubâ€™ 3-way matching, and trying 4th/5th matches if all 3 of the original matches are detected as combed (p/c/n + u/b) The parenthesis at the end indicate the matches that would be used for that mode assuming order=tff (and field on auto or top). In terms of speed pc mode is by far the fastest and pcn_ub is the slowest. Default value is pc_n.
        ppsrc:
            Mark the main input stream as a pre-processed input, and enable the secondary input stream as the clean source to pick the fields from. See the filter introduction for more details. It is similar to the clip2 feature from VFM/TFM. Default value is 0 (disabled).
        field:
            Set the field to match from. It is recommended to set this to the same value as order unless you experience matching failures with that setting. In certain circumstances changing the field that is used to match from can have a large impact on matching performance. Available values are: â€˜autoâ€™ Automatic (same value as order). â€˜bottomâ€™ Match from the bottom field. â€˜topâ€™ Match from the top field. Default value is auto.
        mchroma:
            Set whether or not chroma is included during the match comparisons. In most cases it is recommended to leave this enabled. You should set this to 0 only if your clip has bad chroma problems such as heavy rainbowing or other artifacts. Setting this to 0 could also be used to speed things up at the cost of some accuracy. Default value is 1.
        y0:
            These define an exclusion band which excludes the lines between y0 and y1 from being included in the field matching decision. An exclusion band can be used to ignore subtitles, a logo, or other things that may interfere with the matching. y0 sets the starting scan line and y1 sets the ending line; all lines in between y0 and y1 (including y0 and y1) will be ignored. Setting y0 and y1 to the same value will disable the feature. y0 and y1 defaults to 0.
        y1:
            These define an exclusion band which excludes the lines between y0 and y1 from being included in the field matching decision. An exclusion band can be used to ignore subtitles, a logo, or other things that may interfere with the matching. y0 sets the starting scan line and y1 sets the ending line; all lines in between y0 and y1 (including y0 and y1) will be ignored. Setting y0 and y1 to the same value will disable the feature. y0 and y1 defaults to 0.
        scthresh:
            Set the scene change detection threshold as a percentage of maximum change on the luma plane. Good values are in the [8.0, 14.0] range. Scene change detection is only relevant in case combmatch=sc. The range for scthresh is [0.0, 100.0]. Default value is 12.0.
        combmatch:
            When combatch is not none, fieldmatch will take into account the combed scores of matches when deciding what match to use as the final match. Available values are: â€˜noneâ€™ No final matching based on combed scores. â€˜scâ€™ Combed scores are only used when a scene change is detected. â€˜fullâ€™ Use combed scores all the time. Default is sc.
        combdbg:
            Force fieldmatch to calculate the combed metrics for certain matches and print them. This setting is known as micout in TFM/VFM vocabulary. Available values are: â€˜noneâ€™ No forced calculation. â€˜pcnâ€™ Force p/c/n calculations. â€˜pcnubâ€™ Force p/c/n/u/b calculations. Default value is none.
        cthresh:
            This is the area combing threshold used for combed frame detection. This essentially controls how "strong" or "visible" combing must be to be detected. Larger values mean combing must be more visible and smaller values mean combing can be less visible or strong and still be detected. Valid settings are from -1 (every pixel will be detected as combed) to 255 (no pixel will be detected as combed). This is basically a pixel difference value. A good range is [8, 12]. Default value is 9.
        chroma:
            Sets whether or not chroma is considered in the combed frame decision. Only disable this if your source has chroma problems (rainbowing, etc.) that are causing problems for the combed frame detection with chroma enabled. Actually, using chroma=0 is usually more reliable, except for the case where there is chroma only combing in the source. Default value is 0.
        blockx:
            Respectively set the x-axis and y-axis size of the window used during combed frame detection. This has to do with the size of the area in which combpel pixels are required to be detected as combed for a frame to be declared combed. See the combpel parameter description for more info. Possible values are any number that is a power of 2 starting at 4 and going up to 512. Default value is 16.
        blocky:
            Respectively set the x-axis and y-axis size of the window used during combed frame detection. This has to do with the size of the area in which combpel pixels are required to be detected as combed for a frame to be declared combed. See the combpel parameter description for more info. Possible values are any number that is a power of 2 starting at 4 and going up to 512. Default value is 16.
        combpel:
            The number of combed pixels inside any of the blocky by blockx size blocks on the frame for the frame to be detected as combed. While cthresh controls how "visible" the combing must be, this setting controls "how much" combing there must be in any localized area (a window defined by the blockx and blocky settings) on the frame. Minimum value is 0 and maximum is blocky x blockx (at which point no frames will ever be detected as combed). This setting is known as MI in TFM/VFM vocabulary. Default value is 80.

        11.108 fspp Apply fast and simple postprocessing. It is a faster version of spp. It splits (I)DCT into horizontal/vertical passes. Unlike the simple post- processing filter, one of them is performed once per block, not per pixel. This allows for much higher speed. The filter accepts the following options:

        Parameters:
        ----------
        quality:
            Set quality. This option defines the number of levels for averaging. It accepts an integer in the range 4-5. Default value is 4.
        qp:
            Force a constant quantization parameter. It accepts an integer in range 0-63. If not set, the filter will use the QP from the video stream (if available).
        strength:
            Set filter strength. It accepts an integer in range -15 to 32. Lower values mean more details but also more artifacts, while higher values make the image smoother but also blurrier. Default value is 0 âˆ’ PSNR optimal.
        use_bframe_qp:
            Enable the use of the QP from the B-Frames if set to 1. Using this option may cause flicker since the B-Frames have often larger QP. Default is 0 (not enabled).

This also specify number of input streams. Number of input streams must be not less than number of channels in first stream plus one.
        gain:
            Set gain applied to audio. Value is in dB. Default is 0.
        type:
            Set processing type. Can be time or freq. time is processing audio in time domain which is slow. freq is processing audio in frequency domain which is fast. Default is freq.
        lfe:
            Set custom gain for LFE channels. Value is in dB. Default is 0.
        size:
            Set size of frame in number of samples which will be processed at once. Default value is 1024. Allowed range is from 1024 to 96000.
        hrir:
            Set format of hrir stream. Default value is stereo. Alternative value is multich. If value is set to stereo, number of additional streams should be greater or equal to number of input channels in first input stream. Also each additional stream should have stereo number of channels. If value is set to multich, number of additional streams should be exactly one. Also number of input channels of additional stream should be equal or greater than twice number of channels of first input stream.

This filter is useful only for correcting degraded or poorly captured source video. The filter accepts the following options:

        Parameters:
        ----------
        strength:
            Determine the amount of equalization to be applied. As the strength is reduced, the distribution of pixel intensities more-and-more approaches that of the input frame. The value must be a float number in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.200.
        intensity:
            Set the maximum intensity that can generated and scale the output values appropriately. The strength should be set as desired and then the intensity can be limited if needed to avoid washing-out. The value must be a float number in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.210.
        antibanding:
            Set the antibanding level. If enabled the filter will randomly vary the luminance of output pixels by a small amount to avoid banding of the histogram. Possible values are none, weak or strong. It defaults to none.

        11.122 hwmap Map hardware frames to system memory or to another device. This filter has several different modes of operation; which one is used depends on the input and output formats: Hardware frame input, normal frame output Map the input frames to system memory and pass them to the output. If the original hardware frame is later required (for example, after overlaying something else on part of it), the hwmap filter can be used again in the next mode to retrieve it. Normal frame input, hardware frame output If the input is actually a software-mapped hardware frame, then unmap it - that is, return the original hardware frame. Otherwise, a device must be provided. Create new hardware surfaces on that device for the output, then map them back to the software format at the input and give those frames to the preceding filter. This will then act like the hwupload filter, but may be able to avoid an additional copy when the input is already in a compatible format. Hardware frame input and output A device must be supplied for the output, either directly or with the derive_device option. The input and output devices must be of different types and compatible - the exact meaning of this is system-dependent, but typically it means that they must refer to the same underlying hardware context (for example, refer to the same graphics card). If the input frames were originally created on the output device, then unmap to retrieve the original frames. Otherwise, map the frames to the output device - create new hardware frames on the output corresponding to the frames on the input. The following additional parameters are accepted:

        Parameters:
        ----------
        mode:
            Set the frame mapping mode. Some combination of: read The mapped frame should be readable. write The mapped frame should be writeable. overwrite The mapping will always overwrite the entire frame. This may improve performance in some cases, as the original contents of the frame need not be loaded. direct The mapping must not involve any copying. Indirect mappings to copies of frames are created in some cases where either direct mapping is not possible or it would have unexpected properties. Setting this flag ensures that the mapping is direct and will fail if that is not possible. Defaults to read+write if not specified.
        derive_device:
            Rather than using the device supplied at initialisation, instead derive a new device of type type from the device the input frames exist on.
        reverse:
            In a hardware to hardware mapping, map in reverse - create frames in the sink and map them back to the source. This may be necessary in some cases where a mapping in one direction is required but only the opposite direction is supported by the devices being used. This option is dangerous - it may break the preceding filter in undefined ways if there are any additional constraints on that filterâ€™s output. Do not use it without fully understanding the implications of its use.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        file:
            Specifies the name of LADSPA plugin library to load. If the environment variable LADSPA_PATH is defined, the LADSPA plugin is searched in each one of the directories specified by the colon separated list in LADSPA_PATH, otherwise in the standard LADSPA paths, which are in this order: HOME/.ladspa/lib/, /usr/local/lib/ladspa/, /usr/lib/ladspa/.
        plugin:
            Specifies the plugin within the library. Some libraries contain only one plugin, but others contain many of them. If this is not set filter will list all available plugins within the specified library.
        controls:
            Set the â€™|â€™ separated list of controls which are zero or more floating point values that determine the behavior of the loaded plugin (for example delay, threshold or gain). Controls need to be defined using the following syntax: c0=value0|c1=value1|c2=value2|..., where valuei is the value set on the i-th control. Alternatively they can be also defined using the following syntax: value0|value1|value2|..., where valuei is the value set on the i-th control. If controls is set to help, all available controls and their valid ranges are printed.
        sample_rate:
            Specify the sample rate, default to 44100. Only used if plugin have zero inputs.
        nb_samples:
            Set the number of samples per channel per each output frame, default is 1024. Only used if plugin have zero inputs.
        duration:
            Set the minimum duration of the sourced audio. See (ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual for the accepted syntax. Note that the resulting duration may be greater than the specified duration, as the generated audio is always cut at the end of a complete frame. If not specified, or the expressed duration is negative, the audio is supposed to be generated forever. Only used if plugin have zero inputs.
        latency:
            Enable latency compensation, by default is disabled. Only used if plugin have inputs.

        11.142 lenscorrection Correct radial lens distortion This filter can be used to correct for radial distortion as can result from the use of wide angle lenses, and thereby re-rectify the image. To find the right parameters one can use tools available for example as part of opencv or simply trial-and-error. To use opencv use the calibration sample (under samples/cpp) from the opencv sources and extract the k1 and k2 coefficients from the resulting matrix. Note that effectively the same filter is available in the open-source tools Krita and Digikam from the KDE project. In contrast to the vignette filter, which can also be used to compensate lens errors, this filter corrects the distortion of the image, whereas vignette corrects the brightness distribution, so you may want to use both filters together in certain cases, though you will have to take care of ordering, i.e. whether vignetting should be applied before or after lens correction.

        11.143 lensfun Apply lens correction via the lensfun library (http://lensfun.sourceforge.net/). The lensfun filter requires the camera make, camera model, and lens model to apply the lens correction. The filter will load the lensfun database and query it to find the corresponding camera and lens entries in the database. As long as these entries can be found with the given options, the filter can perform corrections on frames. Note that incomplete strings will result in the filter choosing the best match with the given options, and the filter will output the chosen camera and lens models (logged with level "info"). You must provide the make, camera model, and lens model as they are required. To obtain a list of available makes and models, leave out one or both of make and model options. The filter will send the full list to the log with level INFO. The first column is the make and the second column is the model. To obtain a list of available lenses, set any values for make and model and leave out the lens_model option. The filter will send the full list of lenses in the log with level INFO. The ffmpeg tool will exit after the list is printed. The filter accepts the following options:

        Parameters:
        ----------
        make:
            The make of the camera (for example, "Canon"). This option is required.
        model:
            The model of the camera (for example, "Canon EOS 100D"). This option is required.
        lens_model:
            The model of the lens (for example, "Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM"). This option is required.
        db_path:
            The full path to the lens database folder. If not set, the filter will attempt to load the database from the install path when the library was built. Default is unset.
        mode:
            The type of correction to apply. The following values are valid options: â€˜vignettingâ€™ Enables fixing lens vignetting. â€˜geometryâ€™ Enables fixing lens geometry. This is the default. â€˜subpixelâ€™ Enables fixing chromatic aberrations. â€˜vig_geoâ€™ Enables fixing lens vignetting and lens geometry. â€˜vig_subpixelâ€™ Enables fixing lens vignetting and chromatic aberrations. â€˜distortionâ€™ Enables fixing both lens geometry and chromatic aberrations. â€˜allâ€™ Enables all possible corrections.
        focal_length:
            The focal length of the image/video (zoom; expected constant for video). For example, a 18â€“55mm lens has focal length range of [18â€“55], so a value in that range should be chosen when using that lens. Default 18.
        aperture:
            The aperture of the image/video (expected constant for video). Note that aperture is only used for vignetting correction. Default 3.5.
        focus_distance:
            The focus distance of the image/video (expected constant for video). Note that focus distance is only used for vignetting and only slightly affects the vignetting correction process. If unknown, leave it at the default value (which is 1000).
        scale:
            The scale factor which is applied after transformation. After correction the video is no longer necessarily rectangular. This parameter controls how much of the resulting image is visible. The value 0 means that a value will be chosen automatically such that there is little or no unmapped area in the output image. 1.0 means that no additional scaling is done. Lower values may result in more of the corrected image being visible, while higher values may avoid unmapped areas in the output.
        target_geometry:
            The target geometry of the output image/video. The following values are valid options: â€˜rectilinear (default)â€™ â€˜fisheyeâ€™ â€˜panoramicâ€™ â€˜equirectangularâ€™ â€˜fisheye_orthographicâ€™ â€˜fisheye_stereographicâ€™ â€˜fisheye_equisolidâ€™ â€˜fisheye_thobyâ€™
        reverse:
            Apply the reverse of image correction (instead of correcting distortion, apply it).
        interpolation:
            The type of interpolation used when correcting distortion. The following values are valid options: â€˜nearestâ€™ â€˜linear (default)â€™ â€˜lanczosâ€™

        8.98 lowpass Apply a low-pass filter with 3dB point frequency. The filter can be either single-pole or double-pole (the default). The filter roll off at 6dB per pole per octave (20dB per pole per decade). The filter accepts the following options:

        Parameters:
        ----------
        frequency:
            Set frequency in Hz. Default is 500.
        poles:
            Set number of poles. Default is 2.
        width_type:
            Set method to specify band-width of filter. h Hz q Q-Factor o octave s slope k kHz
        width:
            Specify the band-width of a filter in width_type units. Applies only to double-pole filter. The default is 0.707q and gives a Butterworth response.
        mix:
            How much to use filtered signal in output. Default is 1. Range is between 0 and 1.
        channels:
            Specify which channels to filter, by default all available are filtered.
        normalize:
            Normalize biquad coefficients, by default is disabled. Enabling it will normalize magnitude response at DC to 0dB.
        transform:
            Set transform type of IIR filter. di dii tdi tdii latt svf zdf
        precision:
            Set precision of filtering. auto Pick automatic sample format depending on surround filters. s16 Always use signed 16-bit. s32 Always use signed 32-bit. f32 Always use float 32-bit. f64 Always use float 64-bit.
        block_size:
            Set block size used for reverse IIR processing. If this value is set to high enough value (higher than impulse response length truncated when reaches near zero values) filtering will become linear phase otherwise if not big enough it will just produce nasty artifacts. Note that filter delay will be exactly this many samples when set to non-zero value.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        gain:
            Give the gain at 0 Hz. Its useful range is about -20 (for a large cut) to +20 (for a large boost). Beware of clipping when using a positive gain.
        frequency:
            Set the filterâ€™s central frequency and so can be used to extend or reduce the frequency range to be boosted or cut. The default value is 100 Hz.

            Specifies the plugin URI. You may need to escape â€™:â€™.
        controls:
            Set the â€™|â€™ separated list of controls which are zero or more floating point values that determine the behavior of the loaded plugin (for example delay, threshold or gain). If controls is set to help, all available controls and their valid ranges are printed.
        sample_rate:
            Specify the sample rate, default to 44100. Only used if plugin have zero inputs.
        nb_samples:
            Set the number of samples per channel per each output frame, default is 1024. Only used if plugin have zero inputs.
        duration:
            Set the minimum duration of the sourced audio. See (ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual for the accepted syntax. Note that the resulting duration may be greater than the specified duration, as the generated audio is always cut at the end of a complete frame. If not specified, or the expressed duration is negative, the audio is supposed to be generated forever. Only used if plugin have zero inputs.

The computational complexity of the prescreener nn is much less than that of the predictor nn. Since most pixels can be handled by cubic interpolation, using the prescreener generally results in much faster processing. The prescreener is pretty accurate, so the difference between using it and not using it is almost always unnoticeable.

        11.178 normalize Normalize RGB video (aka histogram stretching, contrast stretching). See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(image_processing) For each channel of each frame, the filter computes the input range and maps it linearly to the user-specified output range. The output range defaults to the full dynamic range from pure black to pure white. Temporal smoothing can be used on the input range to reduce flickering (rapid changes in brightness) caused when small dark or bright objects enter or leave the scene. This is similar to the auto-exposure (automatic gain control) on a video camera, and, like a video camera, it may cause a period of over- or under-exposure of the video. The R,G,B channels can be normalized independently, which may cause some color shifting, or linked together as a single channel, which prevents color shifting. Linked normalization preserves hue. Independent normalization does not, so it can be used to remove some color casts. Independent and linked normalization can be combined in any ratio. The normalize filter accepts the following options:

        Parameters:
        ----------
        blackpt:
            Colors which define the output range. The minimum input value is mapped to the blackpt. The maximum input value is mapped to the whitept. The defaults are black and white respectively. Specifying white for blackpt and black for whitept will give color-inverted, normalized video. Shades of grey can be used to reduce the dynamic range (contrast). Specifying saturated colors here can create some interesting effects.
        whitept:
            Colors which define the output range. The minimum input value is mapped to the blackpt. The maximum input value is mapped to the whitept. The defaults are black and white respectively. Specifying white for blackpt and black for whitept will give color-inverted, normalized video. Shades of grey can be used to reduce the dynamic range (contrast). Specifying saturated colors here can create some interesting effects.
        smoothing:
            The number of previous frames to use for temporal smoothing. The input range of each channel is smoothed using a rolling average over the current frame and the smoothing previous frames. The default is 0 (no temporal smoothing).
        independence:
            Controls the ratio of independent (color shifting) channel normalization to linked (color preserving) normalization. 0.0 is fully linked, 1.0 is fully independent. Defaults to 1.0 (fully independent).
        strength:
            Overall strength of the filter. 1.0 is full strength. 0.0 is a rather expensive no-op. Defaults to 1.0 (full strength).

It accepts the following parameters: A description of the accepted options follows. The x, and y expressions can contain the following parameters. This filter also supports the framesync options. Note that the n, t variables are available only when evaluation is done per frame, and will evaluate to NAN when eval is set to â€˜initâ€™. Be aware that frames are taken from each input video in timestamp order, hence, if their initial timestamps differ, it is a good idea to pass the two inputs through a setpts=PTS-STARTPTS filter to have them begin in the same zero timestamp, as the example for the movie filter does. You can chain together more overlays but you should test the efficiency of such approach.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        x:
            Set the expression for the x and y coordinates of the overlaid video on the main video. Default value is "0" for both expressions. In case the expression is invalid, it is set to a huge value (meaning that the overlay will not be displayed within the output visible area).

        Parameters:
        ----------
        dither:
            Select dithering mode. Available algorithms are: â€˜bayerâ€™ Ordered 8x8 bayer dithering (deterministic) â€˜heckbertâ€™ Dithering as defined by Paul Heckbert in 1982 (simple error diffusion). Note: this dithering is sometimes considered "wrong" and is included as a reference. â€˜floyd_steinbergâ€™ Floyd and Steingberg dithering (error diffusion) â€˜sierra2â€™ Frankie Sierra dithering v2 (error diffusion) â€˜sierra2_4aâ€™ Frankie Sierra dithering v2 "Lite" (error diffusion) â€˜sierra3â€™ Frankie Sierra dithering v3 (error diffusion) â€˜burkesâ€™ Burkes dithering (error diffusion) â€˜atkinsonâ€™ Atkinson dithering by Bill Atkinson at Apple Computer (error diffusion) â€˜noneâ€™ Disable dithering. Default is sierra2_4a.
        bayer_scale:
            When bayer dithering is selected, this option defines the scale of the pattern (how much the crosshatch pattern is visible). A low value means more visible pattern for less banding, and higher value means less visible pattern at the cost of more banding. The option must be an integer value in the range [0,5]. Default is 2.
        diff_mode:
            If set, define the zone to process â€˜rectangleâ€™ Only the changing rectangle will be reprocessed. This is similar to GIF cropping/offsetting compression mechanism. This option can be useful for speed if only a part of the image is changing, and has use cases such as limiting the scope of the error diffusal dither to the rectangle that bounds the moving scene (it leads to more deterministic output if the scene doesnâ€™t change much, and as a result less moving noise and better GIF compression). Default is none.
        new:

The second input is used as a "reference" video for computing the PSNR. Both video inputs must have the same resolution and pixel format for this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one. The obtained average PSNR is printed through the logging system. The filter stores the accumulated MSE (mean squared error) of each frame, and at the end of the processing it is averaged across all frames equally, and the following formula is applied to obtain the PSNR: PSNR = 10*log10(MAX^2/MSE) Where MAX is the average of the maximum values of each component of the image. The description of the accepted parameters follows. This filter also supports the framesync options. The file printed if stats_file is selected, contains a sequence of key/value pairs of the form key:value for each compared couple of frames.

To produce content with an even framerate, insert the fps filter after pullup, use fps=24000/1001 if the input frame rate is 29.97fps, fps=24 for 30fps and the (rare) telecined 25fps input. The filter accepts the following options: For best results (without duplicated frames in the output file) it is necessary to change the output frame rate. For example, to inverse telecine NTSC input: ffmpeg -i input -vf pullup -r 24000/1001 ...

        Parameters:
        ----------
        jl:
            These options set the amount of "junk" to ignore at the left, right, top, and bottom of the image, respectively. Left and right are in units of 8 pixels, while top and bottom are in units of 2 lines. The default is 8 pixels on each side.
        jr:
            These options set the amount of "junk" to ignore at the left, right, top, and bottom of the image, respectively. Left and right are in units of 8 pixels, while top and bottom are in units of 2 lines. The default is 8 pixels on each side.
        jt:
            These options set the amount of "junk" to ignore at the left, right, top, and bottom of the image, respectively. Left and right are in units of 8 pixels, while top and bottom are in units of 2 lines. The default is 8 pixels on each side.
        jb:
            These options set the amount of "junk" to ignore at the left, right, top, and bottom of the image, respectively. Left and right are in units of 8 pixels, while top and bottom are in units of 2 lines. The default is 8 pixels on each side.
        sb:
            Set the strict breaks. Setting this option to 1 will reduce the chances of filter generating an occasional mismatched frame, but it may also cause an excessive number of frames to be dropped during high motion sequences. Conversely, setting it to -1 will make filter match fields more easily. This may help processing of video where there is slight blurring between the fields, but may also cause there to be interlaced frames in the output. Default value is 0.
        mp:
            Set the metric plane to use. It accepts the following values: â€˜lâ€™ Use luma plane. â€˜uâ€™ Use chroma blue plane. â€˜vâ€™ Use chroma red plane. This option may be set to use chroma plane instead of the default luma plane for doing filterâ€™s computations. This may improve accuracy on very clean source material, but more likely will decrease accuracy, especially if there is chroma noise (rainbow effect) or any grayscale video. The main purpose of setting mp to a chroma plane is to reduce CPU load and make pullup usable in realtime on slow machines.

If you use white (255) for the logo and black (0) for the rest, you will be safe. For making the filter bitmap, it is recommended to take a screen capture of a black frame with the logo visible, and then using a threshold filter followed by the erode filter once or twice. If needed, little splotches can be fixed manually. Remember that if logo pixels are not covered, the filter quality will be much reduced. Marking too many pixels as part of the logo does not hurt as much, but it will increase the amount of blurring needed to cover over the image and will destroy more information than necessary, and extra pixels will slow things down on a large logo.

        passthrough:
            If set to 0, every frame is processed, even if no conversion is necessary.

The following additional options are accepted: The values of the w and h options are expressions containing the following constants:

        force_original_aspect_ratio:
            Enable decreasing or increasing output video width or height if necessary to keep the original aspect ratio. Possible values: â€˜disableâ€™ Scale the video as specified and disable this feature. â€˜decreaseâ€™ The output video dimensions will automatically be decreased if needed. â€˜increaseâ€™ The output video dimensions will automatically be increased if needed. One useful instance of this option is that when you know a specific deviceâ€™s maximum allowed resolution, you can use this to limit the output video to that, while retaining the aspect ratio. For example, device A allows 1280x720 playback, and your video is 1920x800. Using this option (set it to decrease) and specifying 1280x720 to the command line makes the output 1280x533. Please note that this is a different thing than specifying -1 for w or h, you still need to specify the output resolution for this option to work.
        force_divisible_by:
            Ensures that both the output dimensions, width and height, are divisible by the given integer when used together with force_original_aspect_ratio. This works similar to using -n in the w and h options. This option respects the value set for force_original_aspect_ratio, increasing or decreasing the resolution accordingly. The videoâ€™s aspect ratio may be slightly modified. This option can be handy if you need to have a video fit within or exceed a defined resolution using force_original_aspect_ratio but also have encoder restrictions on width or height divisibility.
        eval:
            Specify when to evaluate width and height expression. It accepts the following values: â€˜initâ€™ Only evaluate expressions once during the filter initialization or when a command is processed. â€˜frameâ€™ Evaluate expressions for each incoming frame.

It needs two input streams and returns one output stream. First input stream will be processed depending on second stream signal. The filtered signal then can be filtered with other filters in later stages of processing. See pan and amerge filter. The filter accepts the following options:

        Parameters:
        ----------
        level_in:
            Set input gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625 and 64.
        mode:
            Set mode of compressor operation. Can be upward or downward. Default is downward.
        threshold:
            If a signal of second stream raises above this level it will affect the gain reduction of first stream. By default is 0.125. Range is between 0.00097563 and 1.
        ratio:
            Set a ratio about which the signal is reduced. 1:2 means that if the level raised 4dB above the threshold, it will be only 2dB above after the reduction. Default is 2. Range is between 1 and 20.
        attack:
            Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain reduction starts. Default is 20. Range is between 0.01 and 2000.
        release:
            Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before reduction is decreased again. Default is 250. Range is between 0.01 and 9000.
        makeup:
            Set the amount by how much signal will be amplified after processing. Default is 1. Range is from 1 to 64.
        knee:
            Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly. Default is 2.82843. Range is between 1 and 8.
        link:
            Choose if the average level between all channels of side-chain stream or the louder(maximum) channel of side-chain stream affects the reduction. Default is average.
        detection:
            Should the exact signal be taken in case of peak or an RMS one in case of rms. Default is rms which is mainly smoother.
        level_sc:
            Set sidechain gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625 and 64.
        mix:

        8.106 sidechaingate A sidechain gate acts like a normal (wideband) gate but has the ability to filter the detected signal before sending it to the gain reduction stage. Normally a gate uses the full range signal to detect a level above the threshold. For example: If you cut all lower frequencies from your sidechain signal the gate will decrease the volume of your track only if not enough highs appear. With this technique you are able to reduce the resonation of a natural drum or remove "rumbling" of muted strokes from a heavily distorted guitar. It needs two input streams and returns one output stream. First input stream will be processed depending on second stream signal. The filter accepts the following options:

        Parameters:
        ----------
        level_in:
            Set input level before filtering. Default is 1. Allowed range is from 0.015625 to 64.
        mode:
            Set the mode of operation. Can be upward or downward. Default is downward. If set to upward mode, higher parts of signal will be amplified, expanding dynamic range in upward direction. Otherwise, in case of downward lower parts of signal will be reduced.
        range:
            Set the level of gain reduction when the signal is below the threshold. Default is 0.06125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1. Setting this to 0 disables reduction and then filter behaves like expander.
        threshold:
            If a signal rises above this level the gain reduction is released. Default is 0.125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.
        ratio:
            Set a ratio about which the signal is reduced. Default is 2. Allowed range is from 1 to 9000.
        attack:
            Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain reduction stops. Default is 20 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.
        release:
            Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before the reduction is increased again. Default is 250 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.
        makeup:
            Set amount of amplification of signal after processing. Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 64.
        knee:
            Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly. Default is 2.828427125. Allowed range is from 1 to 8.
        detection:
            Choose if exact signal should be taken for detection or an RMS like one. Default is rms. Can be peak or rms.
        link:
            Choose if the average level between all channels or the louder channel affects the reduction. Default is average. Can be average or maximum.
        level_sc:

        8.107 silencedetect Detect silence in an audio stream. This filter logs a message when it detects that the input audio volume is less or equal to a noise tolerance value for a duration greater or equal to the minimum detected noise duration. The printed times and duration are expressed in seconds. The lavfi.silence_start or lavfi.silence_start.X metadata key is set on the first frame whose timestamp equals or exceeds the detection duration and it contains the timestamp of the first frame of the silence. The lavfi.silence_duration or lavfi.silence_duration.X and lavfi.silence_end or lavfi.silence_end.X metadata keys are set on the first frame after the silence. If mono is enabled, and each channel is evaluated separately, the .X suffixed keys are used, and X corresponds to the channel number. The filter accepts the following options:

        Parameters:
        ----------
        noise:
            Set noise tolerance. Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the specified value) or amplitude ratio. Default is -60dB, or 0.001.
        duration:
            Set silence duration until notification (default is 2 seconds). See (ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual for the accepted syntax.
        mono:
            Process each channel separately, instead of combined. By default is disabled.

        8.108 silenceremove Remove silence from the beginning, middle or end of the audio. The filter accepts the following options:

        Parameters:
        ----------
        start_periods:
            This value is used to indicate if audio should be trimmed at beginning of the audio. A value of zero indicates no silence should be trimmed from the beginning. When specifying a non-zero value, it trims audio up until it finds non-silence. Normally, when trimming silence from beginning of audio the start_periods will be 1 but it can be increased to higher values to trim all audio up to specific count of non-silence periods. Default value is 0.
        start_duration:
            Specify the amount of time that non-silence must be detected before it stops trimming audio. By increasing the duration, bursts of noises can be treated as silence and trimmed off. Default value is 0.
        start_threshold:
            This indicates what sample value should be treated as silence. For digital audio, a value of 0 may be fine but for audio recorded from analog, you may wish to increase the value to account for background noise. Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the specified value) or amplitude ratio. Default value is 0.
        start_silence:
            Specify max duration of silence at beginning that will be kept after trimming. Default is 0, which is equal to trimming all samples detected as silence.
        start_mode:
            Specify mode of detection of silence end at start of multi-channel audio. Can be any or all. Default is any. With any, any sample from any channel that is detected as non-silence will trigger end of silence trimming at start of audio stream. With all, only if every sample from every channel is detected as non-silence will trigger end of silence trimming at start of audio stream, limited usage.
        stop_periods:
            Set the count for trimming silence from the end of audio. When specifying a positive value, it trims audio after it finds specified silence period. To remove silence from the middle of a file, specify a stop_periods that is negative. This value is then treated as a positive value and is used to indicate the effect should restart processing as specified by stop_periods, making it suitable for removing periods of silence in the middle of the audio. Default value is 0.
        stop_duration:
            Specify a duration of silence that must exist before audio is not copied any more. By specifying a higher duration, silence that is wanted can be left in the audio. Default value is 0.
        stop_threshold:
            This is the same as start_threshold but for trimming silence from the end of audio. Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the specified value) or amplitude ratio. Default value is 0.
        stop_silence:
            Specify max duration of silence at end that will be kept after trimming. Default is 0, which is equal to trimming all samples detected as silence.
        stop_mode:
            Specify mode of detection of silence start after start of multi-channel audio. Can be any or all. Default is all. With any, any sample from any channel that is detected as silence will trigger start of silence trimming after start of audio stream, limited usage. With all, only if every sample from every channel is detected as silence will trigger start of silence trimming after start of audio stream.
        detection:
            Set how is silence detected. avg Mean of absolute values of samples in moving window. rms Root squared mean of absolute values of samples in moving window. peak Maximum of absolute values of samples in moving window. median Median of absolute values of samples in moving window. ptp Absolute of max peak to min peak difference of samples in moving window. dev Standard deviation of values of samples in moving window. Default value is rms.
        window:
            Set duration in number of seconds used to calculate size of window in number of samples for detecting silence. Using 0 will effectively disable any windowing and use only single sample per channel for silence detection. In that case it may be needed to also set start_silence and/or stop_silence to nonzero values with also start_duration and/or stop_duration to nonzero values. Default value is 0.02. Allowed range is from 0 to 10.
        timestamp:
            Set processing mode of every audio frame output timestamp. write Full timestamps rewrite, keep only the start time for the first output frame. copy Non-dropped frames are left with same timestamp as input audio frame. Defaults value is write.

        8.110 speechnorm Speech Normalizer. This filter expands or compresses each half-cycle of audio samples (local set of samples all above or all below zero and between two nearest zero crossings) depending on threshold value, so audio reaches target peak value under conditions controlled by below options. The filter accepts the following options:

        Parameters:
        ----------
        peak:
            Set the expansion target peak value. This specifies the highest allowed absolute amplitude level for the normalized audio input. Default value is 0.95. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 1.0.
        expansion:
            Set the maximum expansion factor. Allowed range is from 1.0 to 50.0. Default value is 2.0. This option controls maximum local half-cycle of samples expansion. The maximum expansion would be such that local peak value reaches target peak value but never to surpass it and that ratio between new and previous peak value does not surpass this option value.
        compression:
            Set the maximum compression factor. Allowed range is from 1.0 to 50.0. Default value is 2.0. This option controls maximum local half-cycle of samples compression. This option is used only if threshold option is set to value greater than 0.0, then in such cases when local peak is lower or same as value set by threshold all samples belonging to that peakâ€™s half-cycle will be compressed by current compression factor.
        threshold:
            Set the threshold value. Default value is 0.0. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 1.0. This option specifies which half-cycles of samples will be compressed and which will be expanded. Any half-cycle samples with their local peak value below or same as this option value will be compressed by current compression factor, otherwise, if greater than threshold value they will be expanded with expansion factor so that it could reach peak target value but never surpass it.
        _raise:
            Set the expansion raising amount per each half-cycle of samples. Default value is 0.001. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 1.0. This controls how fast expansion factor is raised per each new half-cycle until it reaches expansion value. Setting this options too high may lead to distortions.
        fall:
            Set the compression raising amount per each half-cycle of samples. Default value is 0.001. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 1.0. This controls how fast compression factor is raised per each new half-cycle until it reaches compression value.
        channels:
            Specify which channels to filter, by default all available channels are filtered.
        invert:
            Enable inverted filtering, by default is disabled. This inverts interpretation of threshold option. When enabled any half-cycle of samples with their local peak value below or same as threshold option will be expanded otherwise it will be compressed.
        link:
            Link channels when calculating gain applied to each filtered channel sample, by default is disabled. When disabled each filtered channel gain calculation is independent, otherwise when this option is enabled the minimum of all possible gains for each filtered channel is used.
        rms:
            Set the expansion target RMS value. This specifies the highest allowed RMS level for the normalized audio input. Default value is 0.0, thus disabled. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 1.0.

        11.246 subtitles Draw subtitles on top of input video using the libass library. To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with --enable-libass. This filter also requires a build with libavcodec and libavformat to convert the passed subtitles file to ASS (Advanced Substation Alpha) subtitles format. The filter accepts the following options: If the first key is not specified, it is assumed that the first value specifies the filename. For example, to render the file sub.srt on top of the input video, use the command: subtitles=sub.srt which is equivalent to: subtitles=filename=sub.srt To render the default subtitles stream from file video.mkv, use: subtitles=video.mkv To render the second subtitles stream from that file, use: subtitles=video.mkv:si=1 To make the subtitles stream from sub.srt appear in 80% transparent blue DejaVu Serif, use: subtitles=sub.srt:force_style='Fontname=DejaVu Serif,PrimaryColour=&HCCFF0000'

        Parameters:
        ----------
        filename:
            Set the filename of the subtitle file to read. It must be specified.
        original_size:
            Specify the size of the original video, the video for which the ASS file was composed. For the syntax of this option, check the (ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. Due to a misdesign in ASS aspect ratio arithmetic, this is necessary to correctly scale the fonts if the aspect ratio has been changed.
        fontsdir:
            Set a directory path containing fonts that can be used by the filter. These fonts will be used in addition to whatever the font provider uses.
        alpha:
            Process alpha channel, by default alpha channel is untouched.
        charenc:
            Set subtitles input character encoding. subtitles filter only. Only useful if not UTF-8.
        stream_index:
            Set subtitles stream index. subtitles filter only.
        force_style:
            Override default style or script info parameters of the subtitles. It accepts a string containing ASS style format KEY=VALUE couples separated by ",".
        wrap_unicode:
            Break lines according to the Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm. Availability requires at least libass release 0.17.0 (or LIBASS_VERSION 0x01600010), and libass must have been built with libunibreak. The option is enabled by default except for native ASS.

        8.114 surround Apply audio surround upmix filter. This filter allows to produce multichannel output from audio stream. The filter accepts the following options:

        Parameters:
        ----------
        chl_out:
            Set output channel layout. By default, this is 5.1. See (ffmpeg-utils)the Channel Layout section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual for the required syntax.
        chl_in:
            Set input channel layout. By default, this is stereo. See (ffmpeg-utils)the Channel Layout section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual for the required syntax.
        level_in:
            Set input volume level. By default, this is 1.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        gain:
            Give the gain at 0 Hz. Its useful range is about -20 (for a large cut) to +20 (for a large boost). Beware of clipping when using a positive gain.
        frequency:
            Set the filterâ€™s central frequency and so can be used to extend or reduce the frequency range to be boosted or cut. The default value is 3000 Hz.
        width_type:
            Set method to specify band-width of filter. h Hz q Q-Factor o octave s slope k kHz
        width:
            Determine how steep is the filterâ€™s shelf transition.
        poles:
            Set number of poles. Default is 2.
        mix:
            How much to use filtered signal in output. Default is 1. Range is between 0 and 1.
        channels:
            Specify which channels to filter, by default all available are filtered.
        normalize:
            Normalize biquad coefficients, by default is disabled. Enabling it will normalize magnitude response at DC to 0dB.
        transform:
            Set transform type of IIR filter. di dii tdi tdii latt svf zdf
        precision:
            Set precision of filtering. auto Pick automatic sample format depending on surround filters. s16 Always use signed 16-bit. s32 Always use signed 32-bit. f32 Always use float 32-bit. f64 Always use float 64-bit.
        block_size:
            Set block size used for reverse IIR processing. If this value is set to high enough value (higher than impulse response length truncated when reaches near zero values) filtering will become linear phase otherwise if not big enough it will just produce nasty artifacts. Note that filter delay will be exactly this many samples when set to non-zero value.

        flags:
            Specify flags influencing the filter process. Available value for flags is: low_pass_filter, vlpf Enable linear vertical low-pass filtering in the filter. Vertical low-pass filtering is required when creating an interlaced destination from a progressive source which contains high-frequency vertical detail. Filtering will reduce interlace â€™twitterâ€™ and Moire patterning. complex_filter, cvlpf Enable complex vertical low-pass filtering. This will slightly less reduce interlace â€™twitterâ€™ and Moire patterning but better retain detail and subjective sharpness impression. bypass_il Bypass already interlaced frames, only adjust the frame rate. Vertical low-pass filtering and bypassing already interlaced frames can only be enabled for mode interleave_top and interleave_bottom.

        frequency:
            Set the filterâ€™s central frequency and so can be used to extend or reduce the frequency range to be boosted or cut. The default value is 3000 Hz.
        width_type:
            Set method to specify band-width of filter. h Hz q Q-Factor o octave s slope k kHz
        width:
            Determine how steep is the filterâ€™s shelf transition.
        poles:
            Set number of poles. Default is 2.
        mix:
            How much to use filtered signal in output. Default is 1. Range is between 0 and 1.
        channels:
            Specify which channels to filter, by default all available are filtered.
        normalize:
            Normalize biquad coefficients, by default is disabled. Enabling it will normalize magnitude response at DC to 0dB.
        transform:
            Set transform type of IIR filter. di dii tdi tdii latt svf zdf
        precision:
            Set precision of filtering. auto Pick automatic sample format depending on surround filters. s16 Always use signed 16-bit. s32 Always use signed 32-bit. f32 Always use float 32-bit. f64 Always use float 64-bit.
        block_size:
            Set block size used for reverse IIR processing. If this value is set to high enough value (higher than impulse response length truncated when reaches near zero values) filtering will become linear phase otherwise if not big enough it will just produce nasty artifacts.

        11.264 trim Trim the input so that the output contains one continuous subpart of the input. It accepts the following parameters: start, end, and duration are expressed as time duration specifications; see (ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual for the accepted syntax. Note that the first two sets of the start/end options and the duration option look at the frame timestamp, while the _frame variants simply count the frames that pass through the filter. Also note that this filter does not modify the timestamps. If you wish for the output timestamps to start at zero, insert a setpts filter after the trim filter. If multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries to be greedy and keep all the frames that match at least one of the specified constraints. To keep only the part that matches all the constraints at once, chain multiple trim filters. The defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is possible to set e.g. just the end values to keep everything before the specified time. Examples: Drop everything except the second minute of input: ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf trim=60:120 Keep only the first second: ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf trim=duration=1

        Parameters:
        ----------
        start:
            Specify the time of the start of the kept section, i.e. the frame with the timestamp start will be the first frame in the output.
        end:
            Specify the time of the first frame that will be dropped, i.e. the frame immediately preceding the one with the timestamp end will be the last frame in the output.
        start_pts:
            This is the same as start, except this option sets the start timestamp in timebase units instead of seconds.
        end_pts:
            This is the same as end, except this option sets the end timestamp in timebase units instead of seconds.
        duration:
            The maximum duration of the output in seconds.
        start_frame:
            The number of the first frame that should be passed to the output.
        end_frame:

        11.270 vaguedenoiser Apply a wavelet based denoiser. It transforms each frame from the video input into the wavelet domain, using Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau 9/7. Then it applies some filtering to the obtained coefficients. It does an inverse wavelet transform after. Due to wavelet properties, it should give a nice smoothed result, and reduced noise, without blurring picture features. This filter accepts the following options:

        Parameters:
        ----------
        threshold:
            The filtering strength. The higher, the more filtered the video will be. Hard thresholding can use a higher threshold than soft thresholding before the video looks overfiltered. Default value is 2.
        method:
            The filtering method the filter will use. It accepts the following values: â€˜hardâ€™ All values under the threshold will be zeroed. â€˜softâ€™ All values under the threshold will be zeroed. All values above will be reduced by the threshold. â€˜garroteâ€™ Scales or nullifies coefficients - intermediary between (more) soft and (less) hard thresholding. Default is garrote.
        nsteps:
            Number of times, the wavelet will decompose the picture. Picture canâ€™t be decomposed beyond a particular point (typically, 8 for a 640x480 frame - as 2^9 = 512 > 480). Valid values are integers between 1 and 32. Default value is 6.
        percent:
            Partial of full denoising (limited coefficients shrinking), from 0 to 100. Default value is 85.
        planes:
            A list of the planes to process. By default all planes are processed.
        type:
            The threshold type the filter will use. It accepts the following values: â€˜universalâ€™ Threshold used is same for all decompositions. â€˜bayesâ€™ Threshold used depends also on each decomposition coefficients. Default is universal.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        mode:
            Set vectorscope mode. It accepts the following values: â€˜grayâ€™ â€˜tintâ€™ Gray values are displayed on graph, higher brightness means more pixels have same component color value on location in graph. This is the default mode. â€˜colorâ€™ Gray values are displayed on graph. Surrounding pixels values which are not present in video frame are drawn in gradient of 2 color components which are set by option x and y. The 3rd color component is static. â€˜color2â€™ Actual color components values present in video frame are displayed on graph. â€˜color3â€™ Similar as color2 but higher frequency of same values x and y on graph increases value of another color component, which is luminance by default values of x and y. â€˜color4â€™ Actual colors present in video frame are displayed on graph. If two different colors map to same position on graph then color with higher value of component not present in graph is picked. â€˜color5â€™ Gray values are displayed on graph. Similar to color but with 3rd color component picked from radial gradient.
        x:
            Set which color component will be represented on X-axis. Default is 1.
        y:
            Set which color component will be represented on Y-axis. Default is 2.
        intensity:
            Set intensity, used by modes: gray, color, color3 and color5 for increasing brightness of color component which represents frequency of (X, Y) location in graph.
        envelope:
            â€˜noneâ€™ No envelope, this is default. â€˜instantâ€™ Instant envelope, even darkest single pixel will be clearly highlighted. â€˜peakâ€™ Hold maximum and minimum values presented in graph over time. This way you can still spot out of range values without constantly looking at vectorscope. â€˜peak+instantâ€™ Peak and instant envelope combined together.
        graticule:
            Set what kind of graticule to draw. â€˜noneâ€™ â€˜greenâ€™ â€˜colorâ€™ â€˜invertâ€™
        opacity:
            Set graticule opacity.
        flags:
            Set graticule flags. â€˜whiteâ€™ Draw graticule for white point. â€˜blackâ€™ Draw graticule for black point. â€˜nameâ€™ Draw color points short names.
        bgopacity:
            Set background opacity.
        lthreshold:
            Set low threshold for color component not represented on X or Y axis. Values lower than this value will be ignored. Default is 0. Note this value is multiplied with actual max possible value one pixel component can have. So for 8-bit input and low threshold value of 0.1 actual threshold is 0.1 * 255 = 25.
        hthreshold:
            Set high threshold for color component not represented on X or Y axis. Values higher than this value will be ignored. Default is 1. Note this value is multiplied with actual max possible value one pixel component can have. So for 8-bit input and high threshold value of 0.9 actual threshold is 0.9 * 255 = 230.
        colorspace:
            Set what kind of colorspace to use when drawing graticule. â€˜autoâ€™ â€˜601â€™ â€˜709â€™ Default is auto.
        tint0:
            Set color tint for gray/tint vectorscope mode. By default both options are zero. This means no tint, and output will remain gray.
        tint1:
            Set color tint for gray/tint vectorscope mode. By default both options are zero. This means no tint, and output will remain gray.

        accuracy:
            Set the accuracy of the detection process. It must be a value in the range 1-15. A value of 1 means low accuracy, a value of 15 means high accuracy. Default value is 15.
        stepsize:

        mincontrast:
            Set minimum contrast. Below this value a local measurement field is discarded. Must be a floating point value in the range 0-1. Default value is 0.3.
        tripod:
            Set reference frame number for tripod mode. If enabled, the motion of the frames is compared to a reference frame in the filtered stream, identified by the specified number. The idea is to compensate all movements in a more-or-less static scene and keep the camera view absolutely still. If set to 0, it is disabled. The frames are counted starting from 1.
        show:
            Show fields and transforms in the resulting frames. It accepts an integer in the range 0-2. Default value is 0, which disables any visualization.
        fileformat:
            Format for the transforms data file to be written. Acceptable values are â€˜asciiâ€™ Human-readable plain text â€˜binaryâ€™ Binary format, roughly 40% smaller than ascii. (default)

        11.279 vignette Make or reverse a natural vignetting effect. The filter accepts the following options:

        Parameters:
        ----------
        angle:
            Set lens angle expression as a number of radians. The value is clipped in the [0,PI/2] range. Default value: "PI/5"
        x0:
            Set center coordinates expressions. Respectively "w/2" and "h/2" by default.
        y0:
            Set center coordinates expressions. Respectively "w/2" and "h/2" by default.
        mode:
            Set forward/backward mode. Available modes are: â€˜forwardâ€™ The larger the distance from the central point, the darker the image becomes. â€˜backwardâ€™ The larger the distance from the central point, the brighter the image becomes. This can be used to reverse a vignette effect, though there is no automatic detection to extract the lens angle and other settings (yet). It can also be used to create a burning effect. Default value is â€˜forwardâ€™.
        eval:
            Set evaluation mode for the expressions (angle, x0, y0). It accepts the following values: â€˜initâ€™ Evaluate expressions only once during the filter initialization. â€˜frameâ€™ Evaluate expressions for each incoming frame. This is way slower than the â€˜initâ€™ mode since it requires all the scalers to be re-computed, but it allows advanced dynamic expressions. Default value is â€˜initâ€™.
        dither:
            Set dithering to reduce the circular banding effects. Default is 1 (enabled).
        aspect:
            Set vignette aspect. This setting allows one to adjust the shape of the vignette. Setting this value to the SAR of the input will make a rectangular vignetting following the dimensions of the video. Default is 1/1.

            The picture field parity assumed for the input interlaced video. It accepts one of the following values: tff Assume the top field is first. bff Assume the bottom field is first. auto Enable automatic detection of field parity. The default value is auto. If the interlacing is unknown or the decoder does not export this information, top field first will be assumed.
        deint:

        11.283 waveform Video waveform monitor. The waveform monitor plots color component intensity. By default luma only. Each column of the waveform corresponds to a column of pixels in the source video. It accepts the following options:

        Parameters:
        ----------
        mode:
            Can be either row, or column. Default is column. In row mode, the graph on the left side represents color component value 0 and the right side represents value = 255. In column mode, the top side represents color component value = 0 and bottom side represents value = 255.
        intensity:
            Set intensity. Smaller values are useful to find out how many values of the same luminance are distributed across input rows/columns. Default value is 0.04. Allowed range is [0, 1].
        mirror:
            Set mirroring mode. 0 means unmirrored, 1 means mirrored. In mirrored mode, higher values will be represented on the left side for row mode and at the top for column mode. Default is 1 (mirrored).
        display:
            Set display mode. It accepts the following values: â€˜overlayâ€™ Presents information identical to that in the parade, except that the graphs representing color components are superimposed directly over one another. This display mode makes it easier to spot relative differences or similarities in overlapping areas of the color components that are supposed to be identical, such as neutral whites, grays, or blacks. â€˜stackâ€™ Display separate graph for the color components side by side in row mode or one below the other in column mode. â€˜paradeâ€™ Display separate graph for the color components side by side in column mode or one below the other in row mode. Using this display mode makes it easy to spot color casts in the highlights and shadows of an image, by comparing the contours of the top and the bottom graphs of each waveform. Since whites, grays, and blacks are characterized by exactly equal amounts of red, green, and blue, neutral areas of the picture should display three waveforms of roughly equal width/height. If not, the correction is easy to perform by making level adjustments the three waveforms. Default is stack.
        components:
            Set which color components to display. Default is 1, which means only luma or red color component if input is in RGB colorspace. If is set for example to 7 it will display all 3 (if) available color components.
        envelope:
            â€˜noneâ€™ No envelope, this is default. â€˜instantâ€™ Instant envelope, minimum and maximum values presented in graph will be easily visible even with small step value. â€˜peakâ€™ Hold minimum and maximum values presented in graph across time. This way you can still spot out of range values without constantly looking at waveforms. â€˜peak+instantâ€™ Peak and instant envelope combined together.
        filter:
            â€˜lowpassâ€™ No filtering, this is default. â€˜flatâ€™ Luma and chroma combined together. â€˜aflatâ€™ Similar as above, but shows difference between blue and red chroma. â€˜xflatâ€™ Similar as above, but use different colors. â€˜yflatâ€™ Similar as above, but again with different colors. â€˜chromaâ€™ Displays only chroma. â€˜colorâ€™ Displays actual color value on waveform. â€˜acolorâ€™ Similar as above, but with luma showing frequency of chroma values.
        graticule:
            Set which graticule to display. â€˜noneâ€™ Do not display graticule. â€˜greenâ€™ Display green graticule showing legal broadcast ranges. â€˜orangeâ€™ Display orange graticule showing legal broadcast ranges. â€˜invertâ€™ Display invert graticule showing legal broadcast ranges.
        opacity:
            Set graticule opacity.
        flags:
            Set graticule flags. â€˜numbersâ€™ Draw numbers above lines. By default enabled. â€˜dotsâ€™ Draw dots instead of lines.
        scale:
            Set scale used for displaying graticule. â€˜digitalâ€™ â€˜millivoltsâ€™ â€˜ireâ€™ Default is digital.
        bgopacity:
            Set background opacity.
        tint0:
            Set tint for output. Only used with lowpass filter and when display is not overlay and input pixel formats are not RGB.
        tint1:
            Set tint for output. Only used with lowpass filter and when display is not overlay and input pixel formats are not RGB.
        fitmode:
            Set sample aspect ratio of video output frames. Can be used to configure waveform so it is not streched too much in one of directions. â€˜noneâ€™ Set sample aspect ration to 1/1. â€˜sizeâ€™ Set sample aspect ratio to match input size of video Default is â€˜noneâ€™.
        input:
            Set input formats for filter to pick from. Can be â€˜allâ€™, for selecting from all available formats, or â€˜firstâ€™, for selecting first available format. Default is â€˜firstâ€™.

        11.289 xstack Stack video inputs into custom layout. All streams must be of same pixel format. The filter accepts the following options:

        Parameters:
        ----------
        inputs:
            Set number of input streams. Default is 2.
        layout:
            Specify layout of inputs. This option requires the desired layout configuration to be explicitly set by the user. This sets position of each video input in output. Each input is separated by â€™|â€™. The first number represents the column, and the second number represents the row. Numbers start at 0 and are separated by â€™_â€™. Optionally one can use wX and hX, where X is video input from which to take width or height. Multiple values can be used when separated by â€™+â€™. In such case values are summed together. Note that if inputs are of different sizes gaps may appear, as not all of the output video frame will be filled. Similarly, videos can overlap each other if their position doesnâ€™t leave enough space for the full frame of adjoining videos. For 2 inputs, a default layout of 0_0|w0_0 (equivalent to grid=2x1) is set. In all other cases, a layout or a grid must be set by the user. Either grid or layout can be specified at a time. Specifying both will result in an error.
        grid:
            Specify a fixed size grid of inputs. This option is used to create a fixed size grid of the input streams. Set the grid size in the form COLUMNSxROWS. There must be ROWS * COLUMNS input streams and they will be arranged as a grid with ROWS rows and COLUMNS columns. When using this option, each input stream within a row must have the same height and all the rows must have the same width. If grid is set, then inputs option is ignored and is implicitly set to ROWS * COLUMNS. For 2 inputs, a default grid of 2x1 (equivalent to layout=0_0|w0_0) is set. In all other cases, a layout or a grid must be set by the user. Either grid or layout can be specified at a time. Specifying both will result in an error.
        shortest:
            If set to 1, force the output to terminate when the shortest input terminates. Default value is 0.
        fill:
            If set to valid color, all unused pixels will be filled with that color. By default fill is set to none, so it is disabled.
