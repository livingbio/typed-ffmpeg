"""
Code Generation Package for Typed-FFmpeg.

This package is responsible for generating typed Python code based on
FFmpeg filter and option definitions. It uses information gathered from
FFmpeg documentation, source code parsing, and filter output to create
properly typed Python interfaces for FFmpeg functionality.

The package provides CLI commands for code generation and template-based
rendering of Python classes, methods, and function signatures that
accurately represent FFmpeg's capabilities with full type annotations.
