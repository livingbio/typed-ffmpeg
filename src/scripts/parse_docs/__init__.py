FFmpeg Documentation Parsing Package

This package contains modules for downloading, parsing, and extracting
information from the official FFmpeg documentation. The main functionality includes:

- Downloading HTML documentation from the FFmpeg website
- Parsing filter documentation to extract structured information
- Extracting URLs, descriptions, and metadata from documentation
- Caching parsed documentation for faster subsequent access

These modules help provide context and reference information for FFmpeg filters
that may not be available through command-line help or source code alone,
enriching the generated type annotations with more detailed documentation.
