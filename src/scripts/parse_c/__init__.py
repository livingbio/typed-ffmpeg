FFmpeg C Source Code Parsing Package

This package contains modules for parsing, pre-compiling, and extracting
information from FFmpeg C source code. The main functionality includes:

- Pre-compiling FFmpeg source code to make it easier to parse
- Parsing FFmpeg option definitions from C source files
- Extracting structured option information including types, defaults, and metadata
- Converting C data structures to Python objects for code generation

These modules help create the foundation for typed FFmpeg wrappers by
extracting accurate information about FFmpeg's functionality directly from
its source code.
